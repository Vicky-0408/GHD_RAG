This repo is an essential tool for conducting comprehensive tests and evaluations on a chatbot system. The primary purpose of this notebook is to facilitate the deployment of various configurations to assess the effectiveness and accuracy of chatbot responses. Below is a detailed overview of the contents and functionalities of this notebook:

## Key Functionalities:

* **Database Querying:** Functions are defined to interact with a database to retrieve relevant paragraphs based on user-submitted questions. This setup allows for a focused analysis of the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to queries effectively.
* **Chatbot Interaction:** The notebook includes several functions that manage interactions with the chatbot under different settings. These functions enable customization of parameters such as the model used, sensitivity thresholds, limits on the number of results returned, and the temperature setting that influences response variability.
* **Experiment Execution:** To systematically evaluate the chatbot's performance, the notebook provides functionality to execute experiments using varied configurations. Each experiment can be adjusted according to specific test conditions to analyze different aspects of the chatbot's functionality.
* **Results Management:** After running experiments, the notebook handles the output by organizing the results and saving them into Excel files. This feature is crucial for later analysis and review of the chatbot's performance across different settings.
* **Error Handling and Progress Tracking:** The notebook is equipped with error handling to address issues during execution, ensuring stability and reliability during tests. Progress indicators are also incorporated to monitor the duration of operations, especially useful during lengthy experiment runs.
