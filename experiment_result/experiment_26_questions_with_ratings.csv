1,Who is required to report under subpart W?,"Facilities that are required to report under subpart W include onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, underground natural gas storage facilities, and LNG import and export facilities. These facilities must report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from various sources such as stationary fuel combustion sources, whole gas leaker factors for components in gas service, appropriate default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads, and appropriate default methane population emission factors for LNG terminal compressors. Additionally, the emission factors for different components in these facilities have been provided, including population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and average component counts for major equipment. The emission factors cover a range of components and survey methods, providing comprehensive guidelines for reporting under subpart W.","Facilities that are required to report under subpart W include onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, underground natural gas storage facilities, and LNG import and export facilities.

2,What GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities are covered under the rule?,"Oil and natural gas system facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. Additionally, they must adhere to monitoring and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) requirements as set forth in 30 CFR 250. The reporting of emissions is mandatory for specific emission sources if they emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, as specified in § 98.232. Therefore, the GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities are covered under the rule. The emissions factors and component counts for various equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing facilities have been provided in the tables. These tables include population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for different equipment components and services. The tables also designate the eastern and western U.S. regions and provide emission factors for natural gas transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage.

Facilities covered by this rule might also be required to report emissions under other subparts of the GHG Reporting Program, if applicable.  The GHG Reporting Program requires reporting of GHG emissions: CO2, CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated GHGs: hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases.  These gases are often expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e).",,,5,"The provided answer correctly states that GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities are covered under the rule.

3,Will EPA provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule?,"Yes, the EPA provides guidance on what constitutes a facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, including gathering and boosting, transmission compression, LNG storage, and more. It defines a facility as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, along with CO2 EOR operations under common ownership or control. This includes leased, rented, or contracted activities by an owner or operator in a single hydrocarbon basin. Therefore, the EPA does provide a framework for determining the applicability under this rule based on the specific equipment and operations associated with onshore petroleum and natural gas production. Additionally, detailed emission factors, average component counts, and population emission factors for various components and equipment in different locations are provided, which can be used to assess applicability and compliance with the regulations.","Yes, the EPA provides guidance on what constitutes a facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, including gathering and boosting, transmission compression, LNG storage, and more.

                           ","EPA has developed a voluntary screening tool for the petroleum and natural gas source category to assist reporters in their applicability determinations - the ""applicability tool"".  This tool provides estimates of emissions based on easily determined inputs such as major equipment or operational counts.  While the applicability tool is designed to help potential reporters comply with the rule, compliance with all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations remains the sole responsibility of each facility owner or operator subject to those laws and regulations. The applicability tool only serves as a guide to determine those facilities that are clearly well below the reporting threshold, those clearly above, and those close to the threshold who will need to collect further data to make a proper determination.",,,5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. The EPA provides guidance on what constitutes a facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, including gathering and boosting, transmission compression, LNG storage, and more. It defines a facility as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, along with CO2 EOR operations under common ownership or control. This includes leased, rented, or contracted activities by an owner or operator in a single hydrocarbon basin. Therefore, the EPA does provide a framework for determining the applicability under this rule based on the specific equipment and operations associated with onshore petroleum and natural gas production. Additionally, detailed emission factors, average component counts, and population emission factors for various components and equipment in different locations are provided, which can be used to assess applicability and compliance with the regulations.",2,0.2833333333,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any uncertainty.,,,959,,
4,Do the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements?,"The facility definitions in this rule do affect other EPA reporting requirements based on the type and nature of the facility. The definition of facility within this rule encompasses various physical properties, plants, buildings, structures, sources, or stationary equipment that emit or may emit greenhouse gases. It includes distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties for military installations, electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment, gathering and boosting systems, natural gas distribution pipelines, and carbon dioxide production well facilities. The rule specifies reporting requirements for SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level, with specific thresholds for reporting. Additionally, it outlines reporting requirements for GHG emissions from electric power systems, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper manufacturing, onshore natural gas processing facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, and electrical equipment manufacturing and refurbishing facilities. The provided table data further supports this by providing emission factors, average component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and facilities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas processing, underground natural gas storage, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage.","The definition of facility within this rule encompasses various physical properties, plants, buildings, structures, sources, or stationary equipment that emit or may emit greenhouse gases.

The context clearly states that the facility definitions in this rule encompass various physical properties, plants, buildings, structures, sources, or stationary equipment that emit or may emit greenhouse gases. It also specifies reporting requirements for SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level, with specific thresholds for reporting. Additionally, it outlines reporting requirements for GHG emissions from various facilities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas processing, underground natural gas storage, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. Therefore, it can be concluded that the facility definitions in this rule do affect other EPA reporting requirements based on the type and nature of the facility.",1,0.0947368421,1,The answer provides a clear and specific response to the question without any uncertainty.,,,1396,,
5,"When registering my subpart W facility in e-GGRT, how should I enter the facility address?","When registering your subpart W facility in e-GGRT, you should enter the facility address as the physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Additionally, the provided data includes information related to population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states, default emission factors for various components, and methane population emission factors for LNG storage and underground natural gas storage. This data can be utilized for emissions calculations and regulatory compliance within the context of subpart W facility registration.","When registering your subpart W facility in e-GGRT, you should enter the facility address as the physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas.{
    ""result"": ""The provided input contains several arrays with mathematical expressions and explanations. However, the content of the arrays is not entirely clear and seems to be a mix of mathematical symbols, text, and potential errors. It appears that the arrays are attempting to convey information related to various environmental regulations and calculations, possibly involving emissions, conversion factors, and testing procedures. The presence of symbols such as CO2e, CE, DE, and MW suggests that the content may be related to carbon dioxide equivalent, calibration error, destruction efficiency, and molecular weight, respectively. However, due to the unclear nature of the input, it is challenging to provide a precise interpretation of the mathematical expressions and their intended meanings.""

6,How is the petroleum and natural gas systems source category defined?,"The petroleum and natural gas systems source category encompasses a wide range of facilities and processes involved in the production, refining, and distribution of petroleum and natural gas. This includes petroleum refineries, importers, exporters of petroleum products, natural gas liquids, natural gas liquids fractionators, local natural gas distribution companies, as well as various processes such as catalytic cracking units, fluid coking units, delayed coking units, catalytic reforming units, coke calcining units, asphalt blowing operations, blowdown systems, storage tanks, marine vessel loading operations, flares, sulfur recovery plants, non-merchant hydrogen plants, and more. The category also covers facilities that produce fluorinated GHGs, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated HTFs, along with onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, and hydrogen production facilities. Emissions data for this category must be quality assured, and reporting is required based on specific emission source types and thresholds. Additionally, the category is further characterized by specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment and materials used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as underground natural gas storage and LNG storage. The emission factors and population emission factors provide insights into the environmental impact of these processes and facilities.","The petroleum and natural gas systems source category consists of petroleum refineries, importers, exporters of petroleum products, natural gas liquids, natural gas liquids fractionators, local natural gas distribution companies, and various processes such as catalytic cracking units, fluid coking units, delayed coking units, catalytic reforming units, coke calcining units, asphalt blowing operations, blowdown systems, storage tanks, process equipment components, marine vessel loading operations, flares, sulfur recovery plants, non-merchant hydrogen plants, and more. The category also includes facilities that produce fluorinated GHGs, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated HTFs. Additionally, it covers onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, as well as hydrogen production facilities. The emissions data for this category must be quality assured, and reporting is required based on specific emission source types and thresholds. Therefore, the petroleum and natural gas systems source category is defined by a wide range of facilities and processes involved in the production, refining, and distribution of petroleum and natural gas, along with specific emission reporting requirements.{

You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control.

8,What gases must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities?,"Oil and natural gas system facilities must report Carbon Dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and gas flares. This includes emissions from natural gas processing, gathering and boosting, transmission compression, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment. Therefore, the gases that must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities are CO2, CH4, and N2O. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts for different regions and equipment types are provided in the tables, which can be used to calculate and report the emissions of these gases in the respective regions and from specific equipment components.","Oil and natural gas system facilities must report Carbon Dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and gas flares.

See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors.

10,What information must be reported by subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities?,"Subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities are required to report specific information for each emission source type located at the facility. This includes reporting for major equipment types, production types (natural gas or crude oil), and geographic location combinations. The information to be reported includes emissions data for different equipment types, production types, and geographic locations, along with the use of appropriate default emission factors for calculations. The default emission factors are provided for various components and equipment in different regions of the U.S., such as Eastern and Western U.S. Additionally, there are default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. These factors and counts are essential for calculating emissions and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.","Subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities must report information specified in paragraphs (r)(1)(i) through (v) separately for each emission source type required to use Equation W–32A that is located at the facility. This includes reporting for each major equipment type, production type (i.e., natural gas or crude oil), and geographic location combination. Additionally, facilities are required to use the appropriate default whole gas population emission factors listed in Table W–1A, W–1B, W–1C, W–1E, W–2, W–3A, W–4A, and W–4B to this subpart for calculating emissions from various components and equipment. Therefore, the information that must be reported by subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities includes emissions data for different equipment types, production types, and geographic locations, along with the use of appropriate default emission factors for calculations.{

11,When does reporting for subpart W begin?,"Reporting for subpart W involves reporting the number of days in the reporting year for which substitute data procedures were used. Reporters must retain laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used to estimate the CO2 emissions of petroleum products, natural gas liquids, biomass, and feedstocks reported under this subpart. Additionally, reporters must adhere to specific QA/QC methods for reviewing the completeness and accuracy of reporting, including the use of Calculation Method 1 and maintaining records to support reported quantities. The reporting for subpart W is comprehensive and requires adherence to specific procedures and record-keeping. In addition, there are various conversion factors and emission factors provided in the tables, such as conversion factors for lb/dscf-ppm N2O, ratio of molecular weights, and conversion factors for tons to metric tons. The tables also include population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and leaker emission factors for different survey methods and components.

}","Starting in 2013 and each year thereafter, reports must be submitted to EPA by March 31 of each year, unless the 31st is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, in which case the reports are due on the next business day.  Facilities subject to subpart W must begin monitoring GHG emissions on January 1, 2011 in accordance with the methods specified in subpart W. For 2012 only, the GHG report must be submitted to EPA by September 28, 2012. This reporting deadline applies to all subparts being reported by the facility. If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",2,"The answer mostly lacks relevance as it provides information about the reporting procedures and requirements for subpart W, but does not directly answer the question about when the reporting begins.",5,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question by stating that reporting for subpart W involves reporting the number of days in the reporting year for which substitute data procedures were used. It also provides additional information about the specific procedures and record-keeping required for reporting under subpart W, as well as the various conversion factors and emission factors provided in the tables. The answer is logically consistent with the information contained in the context.",1,0.2292993631,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the answer provides a lot of information about reporting for subpart W, it does not directly answer the question of when reporting begins.

It provides a comprehensive explanation of the reporting requirements for subpart W, including the need for adherence to specific procedures and record-keeping. It also mentions the various conversion factors and emission factors provided in the tables, which are essential for accurate reporting.

15,Does EPA offer guidance on how to estimate a worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for purpose of determining applicability?,"Yes, EPA offers comprehensive guidance on estimating worst-case scenario GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks. The guidance includes specific calculation methods for annual CH4 and CO2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks. It involves using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks, flashing emissions calculation with software programs like AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&P Tank, and determining various parameters for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data. Additionally, the guidance provides detailed calculation methods for different scenarios such as compressor scrubber dump valve leakage, malfunctioning dump valves, flow to storage tank direct from wells, and more. Furthermore, the EPA provides default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, and total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression to aid in the estimation process.","Yes, EPA offers guidance on how to estimate a worst-case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability.

16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting differ for transmission compression and underground storage due to variations in the method specified for determining the volumetric emissions from reciprocating rod packing. For compressors with an open-ended vent line, the method is specified in paragraphs (p)(2)(ii)(A) through (C) of the section, while for compressors without an open-ended vent line, the method is specified in paragraphs (p)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of the section. Additionally, the emission factors and population emission factors for different components and services in the Eastern and Western U.S. vary, contributing to the differences in units used for vented emissions. The specific emission factors and population emission factors for different components and services can be found in the provided tables for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, crude oil production equipment, and natural gas processing. These variations in emission factors and population emission factors further contribute to the differences in units used for vented emissions between transmission compression and underground storage.","The units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting differ for transmission compression and underground storage because the method specified for determining the volumetric emissions from reciprocating rod packing varies based on whether the compressor is equipped with an open-ended vent line or not. The method for compressors with an open-ended vent line is specified in paragraphs (p)(2)(ii)(A) through (C) of the section, while for compressors without an open-ended vent line, the method is specified in paragraphs (p)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of the section.{

17,"For a facility that operates stationary combustion equipment and only became subject to 40 CFR part 98 due to subpart W related emissions, should the monitoring plan have been put in place a by January 1 or April 1, 2011?","The monitoring plan should have been put in place by April 1, 2011. This is because the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit, including those related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution, were required to be reported under subpart C of 40 CFR part 98. The specific requirements for reporting these emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources were outlined in subpart C, which necessitated the monitoring plan to be in place by April 1, 2011. Additionally, Equation W-2 is used to calculate CH4 and CO2 volumetric emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting, involving parameters such as Es,i, Count, EF, GHGi, and T. The tables provide default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and population emission factors for various components, all of which are relevant for compliance with the monitoring plan requirement.","The monitoring plan should have been put in place by April 1, 2011.

Additionally, the answer provides relevant and detailed information on various tables related to natural gas production and distribution, which shows a good understanding of the topic.",5,"The answer clearly states that the proposed amendments to subpart W issued on June 20, 2011 that delay the due date for BAMM extension requests to December 31, 2011 will not be finalized before the existing deadline in the rule of July 31, 2011, which logically follows from the information provided in the context.",1,0.2356495468,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides additional information on various tables related to natural gas production and distribution. However, it could have been more concise and directly answered the question without providing additional information.",1078,,

The reporting rule specifies the information to be reported for petroleum and natural gas facilities, including the use of substitute data procedures, emissions for the first calendar year of change, annual reports covering emissions, and specific data elements for certain calendar years. It also outlines reporting requirements for different circumstances, provides reporting alternatives for units using the four Tiers, and allows the option to delay reporting certain information for up to 2 years. Additionally, detailed tables are available specifying default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states.","The reporting rule specifies that for petroleum and natural gas facilities, the information to be reported includes the number of days substitute data procedures were used, emissions for the first calendar year in which a change occurs, annual reports covering emissions for the calendar year, and specific data elements to be reported for certain calendar years. Additionally, it outlines the requirements for reporting under different circumstances such as an increase in hours of operation or level of production, use of default emission factors, and the submission of complete reporting year GHG reports. It also provides reporting alternatives for units using the four Tiers and the option to delay reporting certain information for up to 2 years.

20,"Do the emissions from external combustion sources with rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu per hour need to be included in the 25,000 metric ton threshold determination?","According to the provided text, external fuel combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu/hr do not need to report combustion emissions or include these emissions for threshold determination as per § 98.231(a). Therefore, emissions from external combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu per hour do not need to be included in the 25,000 metric ton threshold determination. Additionally, the table analysis provides default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, along with average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment. These tables offer valuable data for understanding emissions in the petroleum and natural gas industry, but they do not impact the conclusion drawn from the text analysis.","According to the provided text, external fuel combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu/hr do not need to report combustion emissions or include these emissions for threshold determination as per § 98.231(a). Therefore, emissions from external combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu per hour do not need to be included in the 25,000 metric ton threshold determination.{

22,Should self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W?,"Based on the information provided, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W, as they are integral to the extraction, processing, or movement of oil or natural gas. The process of performing remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells, including high-rate flowback and venting of large quantities of produced gas, falls under the scope of Subpart W for reporting GHG emissions. Therefore, these activities should be included in the reporting of GHG emissions. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts provided in the tables further support the inclusion of self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading in reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W, as they contribute to the overall emissions associated with onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering and boosting equipment.","Based on the information provided, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W, as they are integral to the extraction, processing, or movement of oil or natural gas.

This includes distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties for operators of military installations. For electric power systems, it refers to all electric transmission and distribution equipment containing SF6 or PFCs linked through power lines and functioning as an integrated unit, owned, serviced, or maintained by a single entity, and located between the point of energy generation and the point of consumption. As for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, it encompasses all equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin.

                        ""data"":","An onshore production facility is defined in 40 CFR 98.238 and will report only those emissions from the emissions sources listed in 40 CFR 98.232.  The onshore production facility has a single designated representative and does not include other industry segments or other source categories in its annual GHG report.  Similarly, if a facility meets the definition for natural gas distribution that facility reports only what’s listed in 98.232(i).  All other industry segments under subpart W use the definition of facility in subpart A and report emissions in a single annual GHG report.  Each facility must have one and only one designated representative.  But, the same DR could represent multiple facilities.  Other than onshore production and natural gas distribution, it is possible for a single facility to report under multiple industry segments.  Please see requirements in 98.231(a) and response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 in the EPA’s final Response to Public Comments Document for subpart W.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate definition of a facility under subpart W, including the types of equipment and properties that are included. It also confirms that all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report. The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context.",3,0.2876712329,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and comprehensive definition of a facility under subpart W and answers the question about whether all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report. Therefore, the answer has perfect coherency and deserves a rating of 5 stars.",1062,,
24,What emissions are reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities?,"Petroleum and natural gas systems facilities are required to report annual CO2 and CH4 emissions resulting from venting gas directly to the atmosphere. The emissions are calculated using specific equations and must be quantified using continuous emission monitors (CEMS) for CO2 mass emissions. Additionally, the facilities need to report annual emissions of biogenic CO2, N2O, controlled emissions, and excess emissions of fluorinated GHGs. Emissions from production and transformation processes of fluorinated GHGs must also be reported in metric tons of CO2e. This reporting requirement encompasses various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing facilities. The emission factors for different components, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic devices, vary based on the material type and service category, and they differ between the Eastern and Western U.S. The average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities also provide insights into the potential sources of emissions. Furthermore, the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is relevant for regional reporting. Overall, the reporting and calculation of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems facilities involve a comprehensive consideration of various emission factors and equipment counts.","Petroleum and natural gas systems facilities must report annual CO2 and CH4 emissions in metric tons resulting from venting gas directly to the atmosphere.

The data collection includes information on the type of equipment, service of each equipment, concentration of each fluorinated GHG, time period of equipment service, and more. Additionally, it specifies the reporting of cumulative quantities of NGLs received and leaving the gas processing plant, mass of residual fluorinated GHG vented from containers annually, and other related information. Therefore, the current GHGRP data does include emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems. The emission factors and population emission factors provided in the tables further support the inclusion of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems in the GHGRP data. The equations provide conversion factors and molar volume conversion factors that are relevant for understanding and calculating emissions in the petroleum and natural gas systems.","The GHGRP data includes detailed reporting requirements for fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated heat transfer fluids, and nitrous oxide emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems.

27,What percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP?,"The emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, and natural gas distribution. Additionally, offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. The percentage of emissions reported under the GHGRP depends on meeting the specified emission thresholds and compliance with the reporting requirements. The emission factors and component counts provided in the tables can be used to calculate the actual emissions and assess the percentage reported under the GHGRP.","The emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP if emission sources specified in § 98.232(j) emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment, onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, and natural gas distribution industry segment. Additionally, offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions as per the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. Therefore, the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP depends on meeting the specified emission thresholds and compliance with the reporting requirements.{

}","EPA does not have an exact estimate of what percent of U.S. emissions are covered under petroleum and natural gas systems at this time.  The petroleum and natural gas systems source category (Subpart W) requires reporting from facilities above an emissions threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e.  It is difficult to quantify what net emissions occurr below the threshold.  In addition, facilities below the threshold may not be directly comparable to facilities over the emission threshold due to differences in the types of emission sources covered.  EPA will continue to analyze the emissions from reports as well as linking the information to the US GHG Inventory to identify what fraction of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are covered by the GHGRP.",4,"The answer provides relevant information about the emission thresholds and reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems under the GHGRP. It also mentions the need to report emissions from offshore production facilities and provides additional information about the emission factors and component counts provided in the tables. However, it does not provide a specific percentage value for the emissions reported under the GHGRP.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the conditions under which emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP, including the specified emission thresholds and compliance with reporting requirements. The answer also acknowledges the use of emission factors and component counts to calculate actual emissions and assess the percentage reported under the GHGRP.",2,0.3470319635,1,The answer provides a clear and specific response to the question without any uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides relevant information about the conditions under which emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP, including the emission thresholds and reporting requirements.

28,"How does EPA define a ""facility"" for petroleum and natural gas systems?","EPA defines a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. This includes equipment attached to a foundation, seasonal facilities operating for at least three months each year, and federally owned facilities. It also encompasses onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment associated with all wells owned or operated by the same entity in a single basin, as well as gathering pipelines and other equipment under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin. Therefore, the definition of a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems is comprehensive and covers a wide range of equipment and structures involved in these operations. Additionally, the emission factor data and average component counts provided in the tables offer specific insights into the population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and methane emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as for underground natural gas storage and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. These details contribute to understanding the environmental impact and regulatory considerations associated with petroleum and natural gas systems.","EPA defines a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas.

This level of detailed data is essential for understanding and managing greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems.'}","The GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas systems must be quality assured as specified in the regulations, with specific monitoring and reporting requirements for onshore and offshore facilities. Facilities must report GHG emissions if they contain petroleum and natural gas systems and meet the specified requirements. The reporting includes information on equipment leak emissions, production type, geographic location, and calculation methods used. Offshore facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types. Onshore facilities also have specific reporting requirements based on emission levels and equipment types. Therefore, the data reported under the GHGRP is subject to detailed monitoring and reporting requirements as outlined in the regulations.{

33,"What are the notification requirements when an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin?","When an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin, they must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions source types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted in compliance with the regulations. The facility must also adhere to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements as set forth in the regulations. In addition, specific emission factors for different components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, including population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and leaker emission factors. These factors are essential for accurately estimating and reporting emissions. The notification requirements, therefore, include reporting the specified emissions and utilizing the provided emission factors to ensure compliance with the monitoring and QA/QC regulations.","When an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin, they must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions source types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted in compliance with the regulations.

34,"How do I determine ""actual"" temperature and pressure in emission calculations?","To determine the actual temperature and pressure in emission calculations, it is essential to use calibrated gauges, sensors, or appropriate measurement devices to measure the remote temperature and total pressure readings. These measurements are then corrected to standard conditions using mathematical correlations derived from the demonstration. The actual temperature and total pressure values are crucial in correcting flow rates to standard conditions for accurate emission calculations. Additionally, specific products require temperature and pressure adjustments to standard conditions as specified in industry standard practices. The provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and survey methods, which are important in emission calculations and regulatory compliance.","To determine the actual temperature and pressure in emission calculations, you must use the mathematical correlations derived from the demonstration to convert the remote temperature or total pressure readings to the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter on a daily basis. All temperature and total pressure measurements must be made with calibrated gauges, sensors, or other appropriate measurement devices. The actual temperature and total pressure values are then used to correct the measured flow rates to standard conditions. Additionally, for specific products, all measurements of quantity should be temperature-adjusted and pressure-adjusted to standard conditions specified in the standard method or industry standard practices. Therefore, the actual temperature and pressure are determined using calibrated devices and are crucial in correcting flow rates to standard conditions for accurate emission calculations.{

35,What are the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available?,"{'answer': 'When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations, it is necessary to use the appropriate gas compositions for each stream of hydrocarbons going to the combustion unit or flare as specified in the applicable paragraph. Additionally, if a continuous gas analyzer is not available or installed, the outlet pipeline quality specification for CO2 in natural gas may be used. Therefore, the appropriate gas compositions for each stream of hydrocarbons must be used if a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available. In addition to this, the population emission factors for various components in different services (such as gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service) and gathering pipelines based on material type in the Eastern and Western U.S. are provided. Furthermore, the default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, and crude oil production equipment are available for both the Eastern and Western U.S. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also provided, along with default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. These factors are categorized based on the method used for surveying. All of this information can be utilized to determine the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available.', 'tables': [{'title': 'Onshore

}","Per 40 CFR 98.233(u)(2)(i), if you do not have a continuous gas composition analyzer, then you must use an annual average gas composition based on your most recent available analysis of the sub-basin category or facility, as applicable to the emission source.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available. It also includes additional information such as population emission factors for various components in different services, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, and crude oil production equipment, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. The answer is highly relevant and addresses all important aspects of the question.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available. It correctly states that the appropriate gas compositions for each stream of hydrocarbons must be used as specified in the applicable paragraph, and that the outlet pipeline quality specification for CO2 in natural gas may be used if a continuous gas analyzer is not available or installed. The answer also mentions the availability of population emission factors, default average component counts, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, which can be used to determine the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available. Overall, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",3,0.0460251046,,,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation of the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available.

36,What are the requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare?,"{'requirements': 'The requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare involve the calculation of the annual volume of flare gas combusted during normal operations, as well as the volume of flare gas combusted during indexed start-up, shutdown, or malfunction events.

}","Yes. If an annual report for reporting year (RY) 2011, 2012 or 2013 is resubmitted, then the deferred report corresponding to that year should also be updated and resubmitted as part of the Subpart W RY2014 report. This should be done even if no deferred data has changed from the previous submission.  This will ensure that your revised RY2011, RY2012, and/or RY2013 annual reports and Deferred Data Reporting Forms are correctly linked and can be processed by EPA.",5,The answer is highly relevant to the question and provides a clear and accurate response. It not only addresses the main aspects of the question but also provides additional information about the regulatory requirements for updating Subpart W deferred data submission(s) and how the emission factors and component counts provided in the tables can be used for this purpose.,5,"The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context. It clearly states that if an annual report for RY2011, 2012, or 2013 is resubmitted, the Subpart W deferred data submission(s) must be updated as per the regulatory requirements. The answer also provides additional information about the verification data and information that must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, and the use of GWPs in Table A-1 of subpart A of the part for calculating CO2e. The emission factors and component counts provided in the tables can be used to update the Subpart W deferred data submission. Therefore, the answer is accurate and complete.",1,0.3773584906,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,The answer is mostly coherent and provides a clear and concise response to the question.

39,How does this final rule relate to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program?,"The final rule specifies that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. This requirement applies to natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission pipeline, petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and petroleum and natural gas production facilities. Additionally, natural gas distribution facilities are required to use appropriate methane emission factors and report the specified information as per the regulations. This imposition of specific emission reporting requirements on the natural gas distribution industry segment directly relates to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program. The provided table data further supports the emission factors and components relevant to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission compression, LNG storage, underground gas storage, and distribution, aligning with the reporting requirements of the Natural Gas STAR program.","The final rule specifies that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

41,How do I determine applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources?,"To determine the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, you must report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C of the General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources. Additionally, for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities, specific reporting requirements are outlined in paragraphs (k), (22), and (12) respectively. Based on the information provided, the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources can be determined by following the specified reporting requirements. In addition, the default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, have been provided. These factors include population emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps. The average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment in both the Eastern and Western U.S. have also been specified. Furthermore, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage have been outlined, along with population emission factors for specific components. The data provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the applicability of Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources and determining the associated emissions.","To determine the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, you must report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C of the General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources.

It states that the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit must be reported following the requirements of subpart C of the General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources. It also mentions that specific reporting requirements are outlined for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities. The answer further explains that the provided data, including default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, and total hydrocarbon emission factors, can be used to assess the applicability of Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources and determine the associated emissions. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",2,0.0894308943,1,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation on how to determine the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, without any uncertainty or lack of knowledge.",4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation of the reporting requirements for determining the applicability of Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources.

}","Yes. The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, stating that the offshore facility emitting 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources based on GOADS calculation methodology and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011, as it meets the threshold for reporting as per the regulations. The answer also acknowledges the tables provided and suggests their use for further detailed calculations and reporting of GHG emissions.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It states that the offshore facility emitting 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources based on GOADS calculation methodology and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011, as it meets the threshold for reporting as per the regulations.",4,0.2950819672,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and direct response to the question asked.

}","BOEMRE typically publishes a GOADS study after March 31 of the year following the data collection.  Therefore, for Subpart W, offshore reporters subject to BOEMRE must use the latest BOEMRE published emissions data (which may be 2008, as the 2011 GOADS report may not be available).  As a further clarification, the reporters will report under Subpart W using the BOEMRE methodologies published in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 with the latest BOEMRE emissions data.  In subsequent years, reporters in state and non-Gulf of Mexico waters will report using the GOADS methodologies published in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304, which historically have been published along with the GOADS emissions data.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate recommendation based on the information provided, stating that the 2011 BOEMRE reported emissions data should be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility.

Additionally, the reporting should include emissions from all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types, as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. The emission factors and average component counts provided for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment can serve as a reference for estimating emissions from similar equipment in offshore facilities, ensuring compliance with reporting requirements.","Yes, offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for offshore petroleum and natural gas production from all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304.{

This is supported by numerous mentions of 'annual operating hours', 'operating hours', 'hours in operating-mode', and 'unit operating hours', along with references to operational duration, exclusion of shutdown and maintenance hours, and the calculation of operating time for fuel combustion. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the operating hours for the specified turbines as required in Subpart W via GOADS. Additionally, the tables provided contain emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, as well as crude oil production equipment, and natural gas transmission compression. These tables offer valuable data for understanding the environmental impact and components involved in the mentioned operations.","The requirement for monitoring of 'hours operated' for 'natural gas, diesel, and dual-fired turbines' as required in Subpart W via GOADS is evident from the numerous mentions of 'annual operating hours', 'operating hours', 'hours in operating-mode', and 'unit operating hours' in the provided text. The specific details regarding the monitoring of 'hours operated' for the mentioned turbines can be derived from the various references to operational duration, exclusion of shutdown and maintenance hours, and the calculation of operating time for fuel combustion.

Since published GOADS data are not available, they should use the GOADS methodologies to calculate the emissions.

Additionally, the answer mentions that the provided tables contain default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and other relevant data that can be used in the emissions calculation process for offshore facilities.

Each sub-basin is defined as a unique combination of wells with specific surface coordinates and subsurface completion in different formation types, indicating that they are distinct entities. Therefore, geologic provinces 160 and 160A are separate basins. Additionally, the emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment are provided for both the Eastern and Western U.S., along with the designation of states in each region. This data can be utilized for assessing and managing emissions and equipment requirements in the respective regions.","Based on the information provided, geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production.

}",Geologic provinces 160 (Appalachian Basin) and 160A (Appalachian Basin-Eastern Overthrust area) are two distinct basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production under Part 98.,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. The answer also provides additional relevant information about the unique combination of wells and subsurface completion in different formation types that define each sub-basin as distinct entities. Furthermore, the answer mentions the availability of emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment in both the Eastern and Western U.S., along with the designation of states in each region, which is also relevant to the question.",5,"The answer is a direct and clear statement that geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and monitor the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these facilities. This reporting helps in assessing the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production in specific geographic locations, allowing for targeted regulatory measures and mitigation strategies to be implemented where necessary. Additionally, the provided tables offer specific population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S., which can aid in understanding and managing the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production in different regions.","The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and monitor the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these facilities.

}","When the GHGRP requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production were proposed, EPA’s goal was to provide a facility definition that all producers could directly apply, and that would be both practical and cost-effective.  EPA sought public comment on a range of possible options for defining the facility that would report with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, ranging from defining the facility at the individual well pad, to defining the facility at the field-level, to defining the facility at the basin-level.  Taking into account public comment, EPA finalized the definition of facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production using a basin-level approach because the operational boundaries and basin demarcations are clearly defined and are widely known, and the approach covered most emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. It also mentions how this reporting helps in assessing the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production in specific geographic locations, allowing for targeted regulatory measures and mitigation strategies to be implemented where necessary. The additional information provided about specific population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. further supports the accuracy of the answer.",4,0.334841629,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent as it provides a clear and concise explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. It also mentions how this reporting helps in assessing the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production in specific geographic locations, allowing for targeted regulatory measures and mitigation strategies to be implemented where necessary. Additionally, it highlights the specific information provided in the tables that can aid in understanding and managing the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production in different regions.",759,,

}","Facilities have several options to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring.  If the GOR from each well is not available, EPA has provided flexibility in 40 CFR 98.233(m) and the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category shall be used. If GOR is still not available, then an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization or industry standard practice (as described in 40 CFR 98.234(b)) may be used.",3,"The answer provides three options to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring when a facility does not have a GOR value for a well. However, it also includes an additional option for well venting during well completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing that have a GOR of 300 scf/STB or greater. Therefore, the answer is partially relevant to the question.",5,"The answer provides accurate and complete information about the options available to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring when a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, as stated in the context.",1,0.1538461538,,,4,"The answer provides clear and concise options for determining GOR for associated gas venting and flaring, and also includes additional information about reporting GOR for well venting during well completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing. The sentences flow well together and sound natural, but there is room for improvement in terms of providing more detailed explanations for each option.",3109,,
64,What are the optional delayed reporting requirements for wildcat wells and delineation wells?,"For wildcat wells and delineation wells, the reporting of Gas to Oil Ratio (GOR), Volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production, flowback rate, average annual production rate, and volume of oil produced during venting or flaring may be delayed. However, if delayed, the specific data elements must be reported by the date specified in § 98.236(cc) along with the relevant well ID numbers. Additionally, the emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment have been provided for both Eastern and Western U.S. The average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment are also available. Furthermore, the default emission factors for leakers, total hydrocarbon emission factors for natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground storage, and LNG storage, along with population emission factors for natural gas transmission compression and underground storage have been outlined.","For wildcat wells and delineation wells, the reporting of Gas to Oil Ratio (GOR), Volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production, flowback rate, average annual production rate, and volume of oil produced during venting or flaring may be delayed.

65,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my oil well operations to decide whether I need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing?,"{'summary': 'The gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations can be determined by calculating the ratio of the volume of gas produced from a volume of oil at standard temperature and pressure. The average gas to oil ratio is calculated in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil, as specified in Equation W–18 of the subpart. If the GOR from each well is not available, the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category can be used. If the GOR is 300 scf/STB or greater during well completions or workovers with hydraulic fracturing, emissions must be reported.

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, you need to calculate the ratio of the volume of gas produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. The GOR can be determined by measuring the production rate from gas well(s) tested and the hydrocarbon production from oil well(s) tested. The average GOR is calculated in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil, and it is essential to report the average GOR of all wells in thousand standard cubic feet per barrel. If GOR cannot be determined from available data, specific procedures must be followed to determine GOR. Therefore, the GOR for gathering pipelines can be determined based on the production rates from tested wells and specific calculations as per the provided regulations. Additionally, the tables provide information on population emission factors for gathering pipelines by material type and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. This data can be useful for assessing and managing emissions and equipment components related to gathering pipelines, which are essential considerations when determining the GOR for gathering pipelines.","To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, you need to calculate the ratio of the volume of gas produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure.

This process is carried out by NGL fractionators, which are installations specifically designed for this purpose. It is important to note that plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Therefore, the definition of fractionate and fractionation in 98.230(a)(3) revolves around the separation of NGLs into their individual components by specialized NGL fractionator plants.","Fractionate and fractionation, in the context of 98.230(a)(3), refer to the process of separating natural gas liquids (NGLs) into individual component products such as ethane, propane, butanes, and pentane-plus (C5 +).

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported directly from the natural gas processing plants and associated equipment, including fractionation of gas liquids and residue gas compression equipment. The emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore natural gas processing, as well as onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage, have been provided. The data includes population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and methane population emission factors for different equipment and components, along with the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. The information can be used to assess and report vent emissions in onshore natural gas processing operations.","Vent emissions for onshore natural gas processing are reported from the following sources: natural gas processing plants, fractionation of gas liquids, and residue gas compression equipment owned or operated by the natural gas processing plant. Therefore, vent emissions are reported directly from the natural gas processing plants and associated equipment.{

Additionally, it is important to consider the conditions under which the fuel gas is used, such as in thermal oxidizers or incinerators, as they may impact the need for monitoring equipment leaks. The emission factors and component counts provided in the tables can further aid in assessing the potential for leaks and determining the appropriate monitoring and maintenance measures for the fuel gas lines.","Based on the provided information, the fuel gas lines on the gas processing facility property need to be monitored for equipment leaks, especially if the fuel gas flow rate exceeds 345 standard cubic feet per minute at 60 °F and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute.

}","The definition of “natural gas” in the final rule revision (December 23, 2011) excludes the composition and heat value specification and simply states: “Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture or process derivative of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which its constituents include, but are not limited to, methane, heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide.  Natural gas may be field quality, pipeline quality, or process gas.”  Based upon the finalized definition of “natural gas”, a facility that processes an inlet gas stream which is field gas could be included in the Onshore Natural Gas Processing segment if the process otherwise meets the definition of Onshore Natural Gas Processing.",5,"The answer directly addresses the main aspects of the question by confirming that a facility with specific methane content and heating value is excluded from the Onshore Natural Gas Processing segment. The answer also provides supporting evidence from the emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as the leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. Therefore, the answer has perfect relevance.",5,"The answer directly confirms that a facility with methane content less than 70% by volume and heating value less than 910 Btu per standard cubic foot is excluded from the Onshore Natural Gas Processing segment. The answer also provides supporting evidence from the emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as the leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",4,0.2931937173,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-written and all the sentences fit together naturally. The answer provides a clear and concise explanation that confirms that a facility which processes an inlet gas stream with a methane content of less than 70% by volume and a heating value of less than 910 Btu per standard cubic foot is excluded from the Onshore Natural Gas Processing segment. The answer also provides supporting evidence from the emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as the leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production.

77,Are facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams (and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane) subject to subpart W?,"Based on the provided information, facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W. The text analysis indicates that natural gas processing plants solely fractionating a liquid stream should use the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas liquid for all streams, placing them under the scope of subpart W. Additionally, the table analysis provides emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These factors contribute to the determination of regulatory compliance and emissions management for facilities falling under subpart W.","Based on the provided information, facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W.

It provides a clear and concise explanation of the subject matter, including the relevant regulations and emission factors.

78,How should I calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids?,"To calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater should be used as the threshold. This means that processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are required to report under the regulations. In addition to the throughput threshold, various emission factors and component counts for different equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities are provided. These factors and counts are essential for calculating and reporting emissions from the facilities. Furthermore, the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is included for reference. The emission factors for leakers and total hydrocarbon emissions in onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression are also detailed, providing crucial data for regulatory compliance and emission calculations.","To calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater should be used as the threshold.

The facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold on an annual basis. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. The tables also include population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage.

The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities and the frequency with which facilities must re-evaluate whether they fall below this threshold. The answer also provides additional information about the emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage. This information is relevant and helpful for assessing and managing hydrocarbon emissions in various gas-related operations.",3,0.2994350282,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-written and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities and how often a facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold. Additionally, it includes relevant information about the provided tables containing emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage. Overall, the answer is perfectly coherent and provides a comprehensive explanation of the topic.",812,,
80,"Which takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility- the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) or the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3))?","When determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility, both the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3)) play a crucial role. However, if there is a conflict, the specific requirements of Subpart W (98.230(a)(3)) would take precedence over the general threshold of 25,000 MT CO2e (98.2(a)(2)). Additionally, the emission factors and component counts provided in the tables are essential for assessing the environmental impact and compliance of the natural gas processing facility with Subpart W regulations.","According to the information provided, if a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. Therefore, when determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility, the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3)) both play a crucial role.

It also correctly identifies that the specific requirements of Subpart W (98.230(a)(3)) take precedence over the general threshold of 25,000 MT CO2e (98.2(a)(2)) in case of a conflict. Additionally, the answer acknowledges the importance of the emission factors and component counts provided in the tables for assessing compliance with Subpart W regulations.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that when determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility, both the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3)) play a crucial role. However, if there is a conflict, the specific requirements of Subpart W (98.230(a)(3)) would take precedence over the general threshold of 25,000 MT CO2e (98.2(a)(2)).

81,May engineering calculations be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product?,"Yes, engineering calculations may be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product. The regulations allow for the use of representative composition from the source for the stream determined by engineering calculation based on process knowledge and best available data. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to onshore natural gas production, gathering, and boosting facilities, as well as crude oil production equipment. These factors and counts can be utilized in the engineering calculations to determine the composition and emission estimates for the flared gas stream. The tables also include population emission factors for various components and survey methods, which can further aid in the comprehensive assessment of flare gas composition and emissions.","Yes, engineering calculations may be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product.

84,"Under Subpart W of Part 98, the definition of Natural Gas Processing provides an unclear explanation of fractionation, additionally, fractionation is not defined within the rule.","The definition of Natural Gas Processing indirectly addresses fractionation within the context of natural gas processing. It includes the separation of natural gas liquids (NGLs) or non-methane gases from produced natural gas, the separation of NGLs into component mixtures, and other processes such as forced extraction of natural gas liquids, sulfur and carbon dioxide removal, and the capture of CO2. Fractionation of NGLs is mentioned as part of the separation process, and the rule specifies that natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream should use the GHG mole fraction in the feed natural gas liquid for all streams. Additionally, various emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression are provided in the tables, which are essential for understanding the environmental impact and regulatory compliance of natural gas processing operations.","The definition of Natural Gas Processing includes the separation of natural gas liquids (NGLs) or non-methane gases from produced natural gas, the separation of NGLs into component mixtures, and other processes such as forced extraction of natural gas liquids, sulfur and carbon dioxide removal, and the capture of CO2.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,No answer found,No context found,"The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question and provides no information related to the methods for monitoring tank emissions or the treatment of intermittent emissions from storage tanks.,1,"The answer is not found, therefore it is not possible to determine whether it is true or false without further information.",1,0.0,5,"The answer straightforwardly states that no answer was found, and makes no attempt to answer the question.",1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the given question.,15,,

91,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"Unintentional natural gas releases, such as those resulting from accidental releases, are indeed subject to reporting requirements. The text analysis confirms that reporting requirements exist for emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions, including those from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, blowdown vent stack emissions, and storage tanks vented emissions from produced hydrocarbons. Additionally, the table analysis provides specific emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, further emphasizing the importance of reporting and monitoring unintentional natural gas releases.","Yes, unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases are subject to reporting, as the text mentions reporting requirements for emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions, including those from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, blowdown vent stack emissions, and storage tanks vented emissions from produced hydrocarbons.{

}","Onshore natural gas transmission pipeline facilities must report emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from blowdown vent stacks to the GHGRP if facility-wide annual emissions are 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO2e) or greater. This requirement applies to blowdown vent stack emissions from the depressurization of equipment for both planned and emergency shutdowns.",,,5,The answer provides a clear and accurate confirmation that unintentional natural gas releases resulting from accidental releases are subject to reporting requirements. The answer cites evidence from both the text analysis and table analysis to support this conclusion.,4,0.2753623188,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any indication of uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the reporting requirements for unintentional natural gas releases, and also includes supporting evidence from both the text and table analysis. The sentences flow well together and the answer is easy to understand, indicating perfect coherence.",688,,
92,How do we report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir?,"Facilities must report SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level, including emissions from equipment installed at off-site electric power transmission or distribution locations. Emissions from natural gas distribution, petroleum and natural gas gathering, boosting, production, and transmission pipeline industry segments must be reported if emitting 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources must be calculated and expressed in metric tons of CO2, CH4, N2O, and CO2e. Therefore, emissions from separate facilities injecting or withdrawing gas from the same underground storage reservoir must be reported based on the specified emission thresholds for each industry segment and the type of emissions involved. The emission factors for different components and equipment in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting, as well as crude oil production equipment, are provided for both Eastern and Western U.S. regions. Additionally, the average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment are available. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also provided. Furthermore, default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage are available for reporting purposes.","Facilities must report SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level, including emissions from equipment installed at off-site electric power transmission or distribution locations.

93,Could EPA clarify that the natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W?,"The natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W, as it does not meet the definition of underground natural gas storage provided in the regulations. The definition specifically refers to subsurface storage, including depleted gas or oil reservoirs and salt dome caverns for the primary purpose of load balancing, which does not apply to the storage in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts provided for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering equipment are not directly relevant to the classification of high pressure steel bottle storage as underground natural gas storage. Therefore, based on the regulatory definition and the given emission factor data, the storage in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations does not fall under the category of underground natural gas storage under Subpart W.","The natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W, as it does not meet the definition of underground natural gas storage provided in the regulations.

94,"What is the definition of ""facility"" for underground storage?","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage includes any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way. This includes equipment attached to a foundation, seasonal facilities operating for a full annual period, and facilities meeting specific requirements as outlined in 40 CFR 98 subpart C. The definition also encompasses gathering pipelines, boosting equipment, and metering-regulating stations operated by a Local Distribution Company within a single state. Additionally, it includes carbon dioxide production well facilities located on contiguous or adjacent properties under the control of the same entity. The emission factors and component counts for various equipment and components related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing are also provided in the analysis. Furthermore, conversion factors for different units of measurement are included to facilitate calculations related to emissions and other environmental considerations.","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage includes any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way.

96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"Natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment because the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are determined based on specific sources and activities specified in the regulations. These factors include CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from sources such as storage wellheads in gas service. The emission factors are not differentiated between compressor and non-compressor components, unlike in natural gas transmission, where separate emission factors exist for compressor and non-compressor components. This approach ensures that the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are tailored to the specific sources and activities within the facilities, as evidenced by the emission factor tables provided for various components and survey methods.","The reason natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment is because the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are based on the sources specified in the regulations. These factors include CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific sources such as storage wellheads in gas service, and the default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4A and W–4B to the subpart. Therefore, the emission factors are determined based on the specific sources and activities within the underground natural gas storage facilities rather than being differentiated between compressor and non-compressor components.{

The answer also correctly notes that this approach ensures that the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are tailored to the specific sources and activities within the facilities, as evidenced by the emission factor tables provided for various components and survey methods.",4,0.3040935673,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation for why natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components. It also compares this approach to the one used in natural gas transmission and provides evidence in the form of emission factor tables to support the explanation.,912,,
97,Does Subpart W require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility or does reporting start only when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage?,"Yes, Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility. It specifies that underground natural gas storage facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service, as listed in Table W–4B to this subpart. The default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for underground natural gas storage include specific values for connectors, valves, pressure relief valves, and open-ended lines, which must be considered for reporting emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility.","Yes, Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility.

}","What constitutes a facility, how to determine the reporting threshold, and reporting of emissions from collocated and dual purpose equipment is as follows: 1) As a first step the reporter must determine the emissions from all equipment listed in 98.232(c) for onshore petroleum and production.  Per section 98.231(a) only sources listed in 98.232(c) need to be considered for threshold determination for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. 98.238 defines “facility” for the purposes of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems.  Per the requirements of 98.3 each “facility” must submit a GHG report for all source categories at that “facility”.  2) Note that while identifying onshore production emissions sources reporters have to determine whether the source is “on the well pad or associated with a well pad”.  The location of production wells within other facilities is inconsequential to this determination.  Sources on a well pad or associated with a well pad across the entire reporting basin have to be taken into consideration.  If your emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production are equal to or greater than 25,000mtCO2e, then onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities report as a separate facility and include all emissions sources listed in 98.232(c).  3) Except for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution, which have unique facility definitions, all other segments subject to subpart W are considered in the threshold determination for a single facility.  You would also include emissions from other source categories at your facility (e.g., stationary combustion).  If there are emissions sources that are dual purpose then the rule requires this piece of equipment to be reported under the majority use industry segment based on guidance provided in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (pp. 1606-1608).  4) For collocated industry segments, which cannot occur in the case of onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution due to the requirements in 98.231(a), EPA has provided guidance on emissions reporting in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14.  Based on the information provided, the facility cannot be reported as onshore production and natural gas processing combined (see point 1 above).  For all the other segments, the report should use guidance in points 2-3 above to determine the segment under which the facility should be categorized.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, including the specific reporting requirements for a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recovery and storage, as well as the specific emissions that must be reported.

105,"At LNG Storage sites, how should pumps that are internal and submerged be treated?","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated according to the guidelines provided in the regulations. Specifically, for LNG storage, it is important to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, including pumps, in LNG service. Additionally, the quantity of LNG added into storage and withdrawn from storage should be reported in thousand standard cubic feet. Furthermore, the appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components in LNG service or gas service must be used, as listed in Table W–5A to this subpart. Therefore, pumps that are internal and submerged at LNG storage sites should be managed in compliance with these reporting requirements. Additionally, the default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components in gas service are as follows: Valve - 1.19 (Survey methods 1-6) and 0.23 (Survey method 21), Pump Seal - 4.00 (Survey methods 1-6) and 0.73 (Survey method 21), Connector - 0.34 (Survey methods 1-6) and 0.11 (Survey method 21).","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated according to the guidelines provided in the regulations.

It directly addresses the question and provides a definitive answer, indicating that LNG storage sites adjacent to subpart D facilities under 'common control' are required to report emissions under subpart D 'facility', and not under subpart W. The answer also explains why this is the case, citing the emission factor data provided and how it aligns with the reporting requirements under subpart D.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It clearly states that LNG storage sites located adjacent to subpart D facilities under 'common control' are required to report emissions under the subpart D 'facility', and the LDC should not report the emissions under subpart W. The emission factor data provided also supports this conclusion.",2,0.4293193717,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any indication of uncertainty.,5,The answer is well-written and coherent. It directly answers the question and provides supporting evidence from the emission factor data provided. The conclusion is clear and easy to understand.,605,,
108,"For a liquefied natural gas import facility, do boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported?","Yes, boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported. The regulations specify the need to calculate and report CH4 and CO2 emissions from LNG storage tanks, as well as the use of specific calculation methods for different scenarios. Additionally, the regulations require the use of appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components in LNG service. Therefore, based on the provided information, reporting boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank is mandatory. The provided tables contain default emission factors for various components and equipment related to natural gas production, processing, transmission, and distribution, which can be utilized for emission calculations and reporting.","Yes, boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported.

109,Are natural gas distribution facilities required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulator(s) under §98.232(i )?,"Yes, natural gas distribution facilities are required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulator(s) under §98.232(i). The facilities must use Equation W–30 and the default methane leaker emission factors for transmission-distribution transfer station components to calculate component emissions from annual equipment leak surveys conducted at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. Additionally, the default methane emission factors for natural gas distribution include specific values for various components such as connectors, block valves, control valves, pressure relief valves, orifice meters, regulators, and open-ended lines. These factors are used to estimate methane emissions from the distribution system. Furthermore, the tables provide detailed emission factors and component counts for different equipment and gas services, aiding in the calculation of emissions from natural gas distribution facilities.","Yes, natural gas distribution facilities are required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulator(s) under §98.232(i).

}","For natural gas distribution, a facility, which is the collection of all distribution pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by an LDC, is required to do at least one facility wide leak detection survey per calendar year and has the option to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys; if the facility selects this option, the additional facility-wide survey(s) must be completed during the same calendar year in order to account for fixing one or more leaks in the annual GHG report.  If the facility chooses to fix one or more leaks and conduct another survey to determine that the component is not leaking, it must conduct a facility wide leak detection survey in order to account for fixing the leak(s) in the annual GHG report.  As leaks are random in nature and while some leaks are fixed others are likely to occur.  Therefore, a comprehensive survey is the only statistically relevant manner by which to establish facility-wide leak emissions rates and account for leaks repaired.  Please see the response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1014-9 (Response to Comments, pp. 1281-1282, http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf) for further details.  It is very important to note that the requirement to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys should a company wish to account for fixing a leak does not preclude in any way a company from repairing a leak.  If a company chooses to conduct only one facility-wide leak detection survey in a calendar year but finds a leak during the survey, the company can and is encouraged to fix the leak.  The leak detected though, as noted above, must be reported as a leaker for the entire calendar year should the company choose not to conduct a second survey.",5,"The answer provides a complete and accurate explanation of the minimum requirement of conducting at least one leak detection survey in a calendar year, and also mentions that multiple surveys can be conducted. It also correctly states that facilities are not required to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted, and provides additional information about the emission factors for different components and regions. Therefore, the answer has perfect relevance to the question and context.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the number of leak detection surveys that must be conducted in a calendar year. It also states that facilities are not required to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year and that the number of surveys is at the discretion of the facility, with a minimum requirement of one survey per calendar year. The answer is supported by the information provided in the context.",2,0.3142857143,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,The answer is well-structured and all sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the minimum requirement of one leak detection survey per calendar year and the discretion of the facility to conduct more surveys. It also mentions the use of results from multiple surveys when calculating emissions and provides additional information about emission factors for different components in different regions and equipment types.,673,,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"Based on the provided information, the EPA requires equipment leak surveys for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, flanges, and other equipment in different service categories. The surveys must be conducted using specified leak detection methods as outlined in the regulations. The requirement for annual leak surveys is based on the specific components and their association with vapor recovery compressors, gas service, LNG service, storage wellheads, and distribution stations. Therefore, the EPA does not provide a sunset provision for annual leak surveys, as they are mandated based on the equipment types and service categories rather than the absence of leaks in a given year. Additionally, the emission factors for different components and service categories in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, along with the average component counts for major natural gas production and crude oil production equipment. The tables also include default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for various equipment and services. The data covers a wide range of components, materials, and survey methods, supporting the necessity for annual leak surveys as mandated by the EPA.","Based on the provided information, the EPA requires equipment leak surveys for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, flanges, and other equipment in different service categories.

}","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",3,The answer partially addresses the question by stating that it is not explicitly clear whether the monitoring plan would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle'. The answer also provides additional relevant information about the monitoring plan described in the text analysis and the population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production and crude oil production equipment provided in the table analysis.,1,"Based on the information provided in the context, it is not explicitly clear whether a monitoring plan resulting in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year 5 would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle'. Therefore, the answer cannot be logically determined to be true or false without further information, and a score of 1 is given.",1,0.3144329897,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the monitoring plan described in the text analysis does not specify the exact percentage of stations to be monitored in each year, it provides some information about the monitoring plan and its flexibility, which attempts to answer the question to some extent.",3,"The answer is partially coherent. It provides information about the monitoring plan described in the text analysis and the table analysis, but it does not explicitly state whether a monitoring plan resulting in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year 5 would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle'.",822,,
113,What types of instruments are permissible for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W?,"In Subpart W, the permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage include acoustic leak detection devices and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments. The acoustic leak detection device is specifically used to detect through-valve leakage, and a leak is detected if a calculation shows a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater. Additionally, an infrared laser beam illuminated instrument can be used for equipment leak detection. Any emissions detected by this instrument are considered a leak unless screened with Method 21 monitoring, in which case 10,000 ppm or greater is designated a leak. The emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. are also available for reference.","Instruments permissible for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include acoustic leak detection devices and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments.

The answer accurately summarizes this information and provides additional details about the specific use of the acoustic leak detection device and the screening process for emissions detected by the infrared laser beam illuminated instrument.,2,0.2716049383,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W, including the specific use of acoustic leak detection devices and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments. The answer also mentions the conditions under which a leak is detected and provides additional information on emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services in both Eastern and Western U.S.",773,,
114,"Can data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program already in place, which has a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm, be used to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q)?","Based on the information provided, the State continuous monitoring program outlines specific survey requirements for components not subject to fugitive emissions standards and allows the option to request an extension for using best available monitoring methods to estimate emissions. However, the program does not directly address the use of data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q). The tables provide default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage, methane emission factors for natural gas distribution, and more. While these tables offer valuable emission factor data, they do not directly address the specific scenario of using data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q. Therefore, further analysis and consideration would be needed to determine the applicability of the state program data for estimating fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under the specified regulation.","The State continuous monitoring program requires that all monitors needed to measure CO2 mass emissions be installed and certified by January 1, 2010. The program also outlines specific survey requirements for components not subject to fugitive emissions standards and provides the option to request an extension for using best available monitoring methods to estimate emissions. Additionally, the program specifies conditions under which discontinuation of reporting CO2 emissions is allowed based on emission levels. Overall, the State continuous monitoring program provides detailed guidelines for monitoring and reporting CO2 emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources.{

}",You must follow the methods outlined in the rule. Â EPA cannot provide concrete guidance on using State-specified limits that are not directly comparable to subpart W requirements.,3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information about the State continuous monitoring program's survey requirements and the availability of default emission factor data. However, it does not directly answer the question about using data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q). Therefore, the answer is only partially relevant.",1,"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information. While the State continuous monitoring program outlines specific survey requirements for components not subject to fugitive emissions standards and allows the option to request an extension for using best available monitoring methods to estimate emissions, it does not directly address the use of data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q). Therefore, further analysis and consideration would be needed to determine the applicability of the state program data for estimating fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under the specified regulation.",2,0.0733944954,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the answer provides information on the State continuous monitoring program and emission factor data, it does not directly address the specific scenario of using data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q). Therefore, further analysis and consideration would be needed to determine the applicability of the state program data for estimating fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under the specified regulation.",4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides information about the State continuous monitoring program and its guidelines for monitoring and reporting CO2 emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources. However, it does not directly address the specific scenario of using data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q), which would require further analysis and consideration.

The answer also provides additional information about the various factors and equations involved in emission calculations, as well as the detailed population emission factors and leaker emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage. This information supports the accuracy and completeness of the answer.",3,0.2830188679,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the information provided is relevant and coherent. The answer covers all the necessary aspects of the question and provides additional information about the various factors and equations involved in emission calculations. The answer also mentions the importance of population emission factors and leaker emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage.

However, the emissions for CO2 vented directly to the atmosphere or emitted through a flare from AGR vents should be calculated using the applicable methods described in the paragraph (d). While specific information about using a meter for flow rate measurement is not available, the emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and equipment related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production are provided in the tables. These factors can be utilized in emissions calculations and monitoring processes for AGR vents, even though the requirement for a meter is not explicitly addressed.","The use of a meter to measure flow rates for AGR vents is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

123,For blowdown vent stacks does the 98.233.i reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume refer to a gas volume or a physical container volume?,"The reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks refers to the physical container volume, as determined in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. Therefore, it pertains to the physical volume of the containers and not the gas volume. This conclusion is supported by the absence of gas volume measurements in the provided tables, which primarily focus on emission factors and component counts for various equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering, and boosting. The tables provide data on emission factors for components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves, as well as average component counts for major equipment in different regions of the U.S. Additionally, there is information on leaker emission factors for different survey methods and equipment components, as well as population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression. However, none of the tables contain specific gas volume measurements or calculations, further supporting the conclusion that the reference is to the physical container volume.","The reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks refers to the physical container volume, as determined in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

124,"May average blowdown volumes be used for industry segments (processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports) where reporting of this emission source is required?","Yes, average blowdown volumes may be used for industry segments where reporting of this emission source is required. The method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks allows the use of a flow meter to measure blowdown vent stack emissions for unique physical volumes greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. The measured volumetric and mass emissions of CH4 and CO2 can be calculated annually by the meters, and the number of blowdown events must be retained. Therefore, the average blowdown volumes can be used for reporting in industry segments such as processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports. Additionally, specific emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities in the onshore petroleum and natural gas industry are provided, which can be used to calculate emissions based on the activities and components involved in the industry segments.","Yes, average blowdown volumes may be used for industry segments where reporting of this emission source is required. The method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks allows the use of a flow meter to measure blowdown vent stack emissions for unique physical volumes greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. The measured volumetric and mass emissions of CH4 and CO2 can be calculated annually by the meters, and the number of blowdown events must be retained. Therefore, the average blowdown volumes can be used for reporting in industry segments such as processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports.{

The measurement methods specified in paragraphs (o)(1)(iii), (o)(1)(iv), (o)(5), (o)(8), and (o)(9) of the section provide guidance on conducting volumetric emission measurements for manifolded compressor sources. Therefore, the use of BAMM for this purpose is in compliance with the regulations. Additionally, the provided table data includes default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and default total hydrocarbon emission factors for various natural gas processing and transmission scenarios. These tables provide valuable information for understanding and calculating emission factors and component counts related to gas and crude oil production, processing, and transmission activities.","Based on the provided information, EPA approves the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for measuring individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold.

}",The daily throughput of 0.4 million standard cubic feet (MMscf) per day for dehydrators referenced in §98.233(e) is based on annual average daily throughput.,,,5,"The answer provides a clear and logical explanation that the daily throughput for glycol dehydrators in § 98.233(e) is not explicitly stated to be based on annual average daily throughput. Therefore, the regulation does not specify that the daily throughput for glycol dehydrators is based on annual average daily throughput. The answer also provides additional information about the tables provided, but notes that they do not directly address the specific relationship between daily throughput for glycol dehydrators and annual average daily throughput. Overall, the answer follows logically from the information contained in the context.",3,0.2376237624,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.

129,Do dehydrators which are used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator?,"Yes, dehydrators used to dry a liquid stream do meet the definition of dehydrator. They are designed to directly contact a natural gas stream to absorb water vapor using various liquid absorbents and desiccants. Additionally, the provided tables offer population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering and boosting equipment, which further support the usage and relevance of dehydrators in the specified context.","Yes, dehydrators which are used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator as per the information provided. The definition includes devices that directly contact a natural gas stream to absorb water vapor using liquid absorbents like desiccant, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or triethylene glycol. It also specifies the use of desiccants such as activated alumina, pelletized calcium chloride, lithium chloride, and granular silica gel material to remove water from raw natural gas. The information also outlines the calculation methods for emissions from dehydrators and the reporting requirements for different types of dehydrators. Therefore, based on the provided information, dehydrators used to dry a liquid stream do meet the definition of dehydrator.{

The context clearly states that dehydrators used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator as per the information provided. The definition includes devices that directly contact a natural gas stream to absorb water vapor using liquid absorbents like desiccant, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or triethylene glycol. It also specifies the use of desiccants such as activated alumina, pelletized calcium chloride, lithium chloride, and granular silica gel material to remove water from raw natural gas.

}","However, for the 2011 reporting year onwards, you must include flare stack emissions in the applicability determination, as flares are included under subpart W.Â  To determine facility applicability, you must determine if you meet the requirements of Â§98.2(a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3).Â  Based on the information provided EPA assumes you meet the definition of the source category for subpart W and are only subject to reporting for subparts C and W.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, including specific details about flare emissions and their inclusion in the combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a). Additionally, the answer mentions the provided tables containing default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment, which are relevant to the context and question.",5,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question, citing the specific section of the regulations that supports the answer. The additional information provided in the answer is also relevant and supports the overall understanding of the topic.",3,0.2222222222,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent as it directly answers the question and provides additional relevant information about default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, and whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment.",592,,
135,Emissions from flares are specifically excluded under 98.232(e) but methods for these emissions are provided in 98.233. Can you clarify which section of the rule is the correct guiding action?,"Emissions from flares, including CO2, CH4, and N2O, are specifically addressed in § 98.233 of the regulation. The calculation of annual emissions for each of these pollutants from flare stack emissions is detailed in the provided text, including the methodology for calculating emissions from flaring gas and atmospheric tanks controlled by flares. Therefore, the correct guiding action for addressing emissions from flares is outlined in § 98.233 of the regulation. The emission factors and population emission factors provided in the tables are specific to different components and equipment in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting processes. These tables outline factors such as valve, connector, open-ended line, pressure relief valve, and other components, as well as average component counts for major equipment in different locations. Additionally, the tables provide information on leaker emission factors for various components and survey methods, as well as population emission factors for different equipment and gas services. However, the specific guidance for addressing emissions from flares is provided in § 98.233 of the regulation, as mentioned earlier.","Emissions from flares, including CO2, CH4, and N2O, are specifically addressed in § 98.233 of the regulation.
