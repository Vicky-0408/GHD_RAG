Must a facility indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year?,"At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year. If multiple complete leak detection surveys are conducted in a calendar year, the results from each complete survey must be used when calculating emissions. Natural gas distribution facilities performing equipment leak surveys across a multiple year leak survey cycle must report the number of years in the cycle. They may choose to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all stations. If the facility chooses the multiple year option, the number of stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle. There is no requirement for a facility to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year, but they must ensure that at least one survey is completed and consider the option of conducting multiple surveys to cover all stations over a specified period.","At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year.
