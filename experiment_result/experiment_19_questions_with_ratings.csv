9,How are greenhouse gas emissions calculated for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities?,"Greenhouse gas emissions for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities are calculated based on various factors such as equipment leaks, vented emissions, gas flares, stationary and portable fuel combustion sources, and more. The emissions include Carbon Dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from different sources within the facilities as specified in 40 CFR 98 subpart W. The calculation involves using default total hydrocarbon population emission factors, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors, default methane population emission factors, and specific equations provided in the subpart W regulations for different equipment and components. The emissions are reported separately for each emission source type and are subject to specific reporting requirements based on the type of facility and the industry segment.

We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question about the monitoring plan consistency with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.',1,"The provided answer is not entailed by the given context.
