It outlines the conditions under which facilities are required to report annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Subpart C. The document also provides details on the calculation methodologies and reporting procedures for different types of facilities, including offshore oil and gas production platforms or facilities. However, it does not explicitly address the specific scenario of offshore facilities beyond the limit of state waters in relation to reporting emissions data to EPA for Subpart C. The provided table 'Table W-1A' contains emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, including different regions and services such as gas, light crude, heavy crude, and gathering pipelines. These emission factors are essential for calculating emissions from the respective sources. The emission calculation typically involves multiplying the emission factor (EF) by the activity level or count (COUNT) of the emitting source. For example, the equation E = COUNT * EF is commonly used, where COUNT represents the number of units (e.g., valves, connectors, lines) and EF is the emission factor. However, the specific reporting requirements for offshore facilities beyond the limit of state waters in relation to Subpart C emissions data to EPA are not explicitly addressed in the provided information.","applicable subpart shall take precedence., (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and  Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. ates or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tabl es A–3 and A–4 of this subpart., (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or art.

","However, please note that if, in year 2, your throughput capacity is less than 25 MMscf per day, you are not required to calculate and report GHG emissions from gas processing in year 2.  You would still be required to report other covered emissions at your facility.  This is because gas processing would not be an applicable segment for year 2.  Nevertheless, your facility would still be required to report in year 2, even if facility-wide emissions are less than 25,000mt CO2e, and would continue to report until you meet the criteria in 98.2(i) for ceasing to report.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.  This throughput is re-evaluated annually.  Once you are subject to the rule (e.g., your facility contains a source category listed in Table A-4), your facility must continue complying with all the requirements of this part, even if the facility does not meet the applicability requirements in a future year (i.e., 25,000 mtCO2e for petroleum and natural gas systems). The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question about the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often a facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold.

If the number of years in the new cycle is greater ","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question, as it provides information about Marie Curie being a painter instead of excelling in a specific field.",1,"The provided input does not contain specific information related to the monitoring plan that results in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year five.

124,"May average blowdown volumes be used for industry segments (processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports) where reporting of this emission source is required?","The document outlines the mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities and suppliers. It specifies the conditions and thresholds for reporting annual GHG emissions, including the calculation methodologies and applicable source categories. It also details the procedures for submitting annual GHG reports, including the deadlines and provisions for discontinuing reporting under certain conditions. The document emphasizes the importance of accurate recordkeeping and reporting revisions in case of errors. However, it does not explicitly mention average blowdown volumes or specific industry segments such as processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports. The given input also contains a mix of LaTeX equations and text. The LaTeX equations represent various environmental parameters and calculations related to emissions from different processes. These equations involve factors such as mass of fuel combusted, emission factors, conversion factors, annual emissions, and various other parameters. The extraction explains that these equations are used to calculate and quantify different types of emissions, such as CO2, N2O, and fluorinated GHGs, from various industrial processes. Additionally, the provided tables offer default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and facilities involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and LNG storage.
