1,Who is required to report under subpart W?,"The facilities required to report under subpart W include onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, underground natural gas storage facilities, LNG import and export facilities, LNG storage facilities, and onshore natural gas processing facilities. The document also mentions the use of best engineering estimates for data collection in the first 6 months for newly acquired sources and special provisions for reporting under subpart W for certain facilities. Additionally, the provided text contains tables with emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing facilities, as well as for underground natural gas storage. These tables provide specific emission factors for different regions and types of equipment, which can be used for calculating emissions from these facilities. The emission factors are provided for different survey methods, such as those specified in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). The emission factors are given in units of scf/hour/component and can be used to estimate emissions from the mentioned facilities.","Facilities that are required to report under subpart W include onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, underground natural gas storage facilities, LNG import and export facilities, LNG storage facilities, and onshore natural gas processing facilities.

    ""result"": ""The provided text contains a mix of LaTeX equations, some of which are not fully formed or clear. However, it seems to include various equations related to emissions, conversion factors, and process-specific variables. The equations involve terms such as CO2, N2O, EF (emission factor), HHV (high heat value), EFCF (emission factor for CF4), GWP (global warming potential), and various other parameters related to emissions from different processes. The equations also involve factors such as conversion from kilograms to metric tons, molecular weights, and various other conversion factors. However, due to the incomplete and unclear nature of some equations, it is not possible to provide a detailed analysis of each equation.""

                            ","EPA has developed a voluntary screening tool for the petroleum and natural gas source category to assist reporters in their applicability determinations - the ""applicability tool"".  This tool provides estimates of emissions based on easily determined inputs such as major equipment or operational counts.  While the applicability tool is designed to help potential reporters comply with the rule, compliance with all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations remains the sole responsibility of each facility owner or operator subject to those laws and regulations. The applicability tool only serves as a guide to determine those facilities that are clearly well below the reporting threshold, those clearly above, and those close to the threshold who will need to collect further data to make a proper determination.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information about the document's contents and the lack of mention of a specific tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities.

It also specifies the exemptions, such as when the total nameplate capacity of SF6 and PFC containing equipment does not exceed 17,820 pounds. Additionally, the document includes details about the use of best available monitoring methods and the submission of one-time reports for specific products. The provided equations and tables offer detailed information on emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and processes, which are essential for understanding and complying with the reporting requirements. Overall, the document addresses the impact of facility definitions on other EPA reporting requirements by providing specific guidance and criteria for reporting SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level.","The document contains information about reporting requirements for SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level, including the conditions under which facilities are required to report under specific subparts. It also outlines the conditions under which facilities are exempt from reporting, such as when the total nameplate capacity of SF6 and PFC containing equipment does not exceed 17,820 pounds. Additionally, it provides guidance on changes that could cause a facility to meet the applicability requirements and the subsequent reevaluation of reporting requirements. The document also specifies the definition of a facility and the conditions under which facilities are required to submit annual GHG reports. It mentions the need for reporting GHG emissions from specific industry segments if certain emission thresholds are met.

You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate description of who must report under subpart W, including the specific information that needs to be reported and the methodology for calculating emissions.

8,What gases must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities?,"Oil and natural gas system facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. The emissions are reported from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. The provided input also contains a set of equations and tables related to emission factors, conversion factors, and population emission factors for different components and services in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. The tables provide detailed emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps, categorized by different services and material types. These factors are essential for estimating the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the mentioned facilities.","Oil and natural gas system facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. The facilities include onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment.

","Under this rule, facilities will detect, as applicable, and calculate GHG emissions according to the specified quantification methods. See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the calculation methods and default emission factors used for greenhouse gas emissions for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities.

11,When does reporting for subpart W begin?,"The provided text does not directly mention the specific date when reporting for subpart W begins. However, it does provide information about the requirements for facilities subject to subpart W when acquiring new sources from another facility. It states that for the first 6 months of required data collection, facilities may use best engineering estimates for any data related to those newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of subpart W. This indicates that the reporting for subpart W begins when facilities acquire new sources and are required to start data collection for the newly acquired sources, allowing for the use of best engineering estimates for a specific period. The text does not provide a specific numerical date or timeline for when reporting for subpart W begins.","The reporting for subpart W begins when facilities that are currently subject to subpart W acquire new sources from another facility that were not previously subject to subpart W, and for the first 6 months of required data collection, they may use best engineering estimates for any data related to those newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of subpart W.{

For 2012 only, the GHG report must be submitted to EPA by September 28, 2012. This reporting deadline applies to all subparts being reported by the facility. If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",,,1,"The provided text does not directly mention the specific date when reporting for subpart W begins.

This indicates that the reporting for subpart W begins when facilities acquire new sources and are required to start data collection for the newly acquired sources, allowing for the use of best engineering estimates for a specific period.

13,The applicability tool for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas has an operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons. How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The document provides detailed information on the calculation of annual volumetric natural gas emissions from various sources in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. It outlines specific equations for calculating CH4 and CO2 volumetric and mass emissions, as well as the annual emissions from well venting, flaring, reciprocating compressor venting, and wet seal oil degassing vents. However, there is no direct correlation mentioned between the operating factor for associated gas venting and the barrels of crude oil produced. The document also includes several tables providing emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic devices, compressors, and more. These tables can be used to calculate emissions based on the equipment and components present in the production facilities.","The document provides detailed information on the calculation of annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing, as well as the calculation of CH4 and CO2 volumetric and mass emissions. It also mentions the calculation of annual emissions from well venting during well completions and workovers without hydraulic fracturing using specific equations. Additionally, it discusses the calculation of annual emissions from associated gas venting and flaring, and the calculation of CH4, CO2, and N2O annual emissions when flared. The document also outlines the calculation methods for volumetric GHG emissions from reciprocating compressor venting and wet seal oil degassing vents at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. However, there is no direct correlation mentioned between the operating factor for associated gas venting and the barrels of crude oil produced.{

15,Does EPA offer guidance on how to estimate a worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for purpose of determining applicability?,"The provided text does not contain specific guidance on estimating a worst-case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability. However, it does provide information on default emission factors, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission compression, underground storage, and LNG storage. The text also includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment. While the text does not directly address the specific guidance sought, it does offer valuable data for estimating emissions from different sources and equipment.","The text contains information about the procedures for estimating emissions, including the calculation of emissions from different sources, the use of alternative methods for monitoring and estimating emissions, and the determination of destruction or removal efficiency. It also mentions the use of EPA methods for emissions testing and the calculation of emission factors. However, there is no specific mention of guidance on estimating a worst-case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability.{

It explains the use of different default emission factors for vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting in transmission compression and underground storage. The tables provide emission factors for different components and equipment in various scenarios, such as gas service, heavy crude service, and LNG storage. The emission factors are provided for different survey methods, such as § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). The document also includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering equipment, which can be used in conjunction with the emission factors to calculate emissions. Therefore, the difference in units used for vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting in transmission compression and underground storage is due to the different emission factors and survey methods applied in the calculation.","The content mentions the use of different default emission factors for vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting in transmission compression and underground storage. It also discusses the calculation of CH4 and CO2 annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage for transmission storage tanks. The document provides details on the calculation methods and emission factors for various equipment leaks and storage facilities, which may explain the difference in units used for vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting in transmission compression and underground storage.{

25,What segments of the petroleum and natural gas systems sector are covered by the current GHGRP data?,"The current GHGRP data covers several segments of the petroleum and natural gas systems sector, including onshore natural gas processing, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas transmission compression, and onshore natural gas transmission pipeline. It also includes reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various equipment and activities within these segments. The data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250 is also referenced for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The document also mentions the option to use engineering estimates based on best available data for certain calculations, and the reporting of emissions from specific equipment/activities if they emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The equations and their explanations are as follows: 1) 1.14 × 10−7= Conversion factor (lb/dscf-ppm N2O). This equation represents the conversion factor for pounds per dry standard cubic feet to parts per million of N2O. 2) MVC = Molar volume conversion factor (849.5 scf per kg-mole at standard conditions). This equation defines the molar volume conversion factor at standard conditions. 3) 2000/2205 = Conversion factor to convert tons to metric tons. This equation represents the conversion factor from tons to metric tons. 4) 44/12 = Ratio of molecular weights, CO2 to carbon. This equation calculates the ratio of molecular weights between CO2 and carbon. Additionally, the tables provide detailed population emission factors, default average component counts, and default emission factors for various equipment and activities within the petroleum and natural gas systems sector.","The current GHGRP data covers several segments of the petroleum and natural gas systems sector, including onshore natural gas processing, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas transmission compression, and onshore natural gas transmission pipeline.

}",The definition of facility depends on each segment and the proximity of emission sources to one another.  Generally under the GHGRP a facility is all co-located emission sources that are commonly owned or operated (see the definition of “facility” in 40 CFR 98.6 for more details).,5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate definition of a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems according to the EPA. It includes all the important aspects of the question, such as the equipment and activities associated with onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as specific examples of equipment used in these processes. The answer also mentions the gathering pipelines, separators, compressors, acid gas removal units, dehydrators, pneumatic devices/pumps, and other equipment used in the collection, compression, dehydration, and transportation of petroleum and/or natural gas. Additionally, the answer provides information on specific reporting requirements and emission factors for different equipment types and activities within these facilities, as well as conversion factors, molar volume conversion factors, and population emission factors for different components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions. Finally, the answer includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, and major crude oil production equipment in both regions, as well as the designation of the Eastern and Western U.S. states. Therefore, the answer has perfect relevance to the question and context.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive definition of a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems according to the EPA, including the equipment and activities associated with onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing.

It outlines the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for offshore and onshore facilities, emphasizing the need to report GHG emissions if the facility contains petroleum and natural gas systems and meets certain requirements. The text also specifies the reporting requirements for different industry segments and equipment types, such as reciprocating compressors, centrifugal compressors, glycol dehydrators, and gas-liquid separators. Additionally, it mentions the need to report emissions from specific source types and provides guidance on calculating GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products.

}","The GHGRP covers the same sources of emissions in California as CARB, but there are differences in the reporting thresholds as well as how facilities are defined.  CARB has a different definition for onshore production facilities than the GHGRP.  The practical implication is that individual CARB facilities reporting under onshore production may be larger than comparable GHGRP facilities.  However, there will be more facilities in the GHGRP, and those facilities will cover the same emissions as the smaller number of CARB facilities.  It is not expected that the total emissions covered will be different between the GHGRP and CARB.",3,"The answer provides relevant information about the detailed requirements for reporting GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems, including specific calculation methods and reporting information for different equipment types and geographic locations.

The facility must also report the total annual oil/condensate throughput, the total annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells, and the quantities specified for onshore natural gas transmission pipeline facilities. Additionally, the facility must indicate whether any associated gas was vented or flared during the calendar year and whether the facility includes a well or group of wells where a CO2 stream was injected into subsurface geologic formations.

39,How does this final rule relate to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program?,"The provided text contains detailed information related to the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from petroleum and natural gas sources. It specifies the requirements for reporting emissions from various segments of the natural gas industry, such as distribution, transmission, processing, and production facilities. The text also mentions specific methods and standards for analyzing natural gas, including ASTM test methods and gas chromatography. Additionally, it provides details on the calculation and reporting of CO2 equivalent emissions from different sources within the natural gas industry.

The document specifies that offshore facilities must report annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE, and outlines the conditions under which facilities must report emissions, including the threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO2e for certain emission sources. Therefore, if an offshore facility reported in the GOADS 2008 did not exceed the combined emissions threshold for subparts C and W sources of more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e, it would still have to report GHG emissions for RY2011 if emissions exceed this threshold, following the guidelines provided in the document.",4,0.4545454545,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any indication of uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the reporting requirements for offshore facilities, including the threshold for certain emission sources and the use of specific calculation methods and default emission factors.

However, it did not explicitly provide a direct answer to the question about whether an offshore facility emitting 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011. The threshold for reporting is 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year for each emission source specified in the regulations. Based on the given information, the offshore facility would not be required to report GHG emissions for 2011 as the total emissions from both subpart W sources and stationary combustion sources do not exceed the reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year for each emission source.","Based on the information provided, an offshore facility that emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources based on GOADS calculation methodology and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would not be required to report GHG emissions during 2011, as the threshold for reporting is 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year for each emission source specified in the regulations.{

The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",4,"The answer provides relevant information about the reporting threshold for GHG emissions and correctly applies it to the given scenario. However, it does not directly answer the question and requires some interpretation from the reader.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. The threshold for reporting GHG emissions is 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year for each emission source specified in the regulations. The offshore facility emits a total of 30,000 metric tons CO2e per year from both subpart W sources and stationary combustion sources, which is below the reporting threshold. Therefore, the offshore facility would not be required to report GHG emissions for 2011.",2,0.3841059603,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides relevant information about the emission threshold for reporting GHG emissions and how it applies to the given scenario. However, it could have been more concise and directly answered the question instead of providing background information.",867,
47,"Can we use 2011 BOEMRE data, rather than the previously available data from 2008, for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility?","The document mentioned several calculation methods and tables that provide detailed information on the reporting and calculation methods for emissions from petroleum and natural gas production facilities. It outlines specific reporting requirements for different facility types and emission sources, including the use of Equation W–32A of § 98.233 for certain emission source types, Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 of § 98.233(j) for calculating GHG emissions from atmospheric tanks, and the use of default whole gas population emission factors listed in Table W–1A of this subpart for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. However, it does not explicitly mention whether 2011 BOEMRE data can be used instead of the previously available 2008 data for reporting RY2011 emissions from offshore facilities.","The document provides detailed guidelines and requirements for reporting emissions from onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. It specifies the emission thresholds for reporting, calculation methods, and the use of data from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE). The data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE is referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304, and facilities are required to adhere to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements as set forth in 30 CFR 250. The document also outlines specific reporting requirements for different facility types and emission sources, including the use of Equation W–32A of § 98.233 for certain emission source types.

It clearly states that offshore oil and gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions as per the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. It also specifies that offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction shall report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in the data collection and emissions estimation study published by BOEMRE. Therefore, if an offshore oil and gas production platform is farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, it must report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C as per the specified regulations.",3,0.1290322581,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the regulations regarding emissions reporting for offshore oil and gas production facilities that are farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters. The answer also mentions the availability of default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, which could be useful for emissions estimation and reporting purposes.",1020,
49,By when do onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report?,"Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W must report the information specified in the paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of the section. Onshore facilities must use the appropriate default whole gas leaker emission factors for components in gas service, light crude service, and heavy crude service listed in Table W–1E to this subpart. Offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction shall report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in data collection and emissions estimation study published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 (GOADS). Offshore production facilities that are not under BOEMRE jurisdiction must use the most recent monitoring methods and calculation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 250.304 to calculate and report annual emissions (GOADS). Facilities must report emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment only if emission sources specified in § 98.232(c) emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.","Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W must report the information specified in the paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of the section.

It also correctly explains that there is no specific information or calculation method provided in the input to determine whether the average throughput of oil is an annual or daily average. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",2,0.2195121951,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the document does not explicitly mention whether the average throughput of oil in 98.233(j)(1) is an annual or daily average, the provided information includes tables related to emission factors and component counts for natural gas and crude oil production equipment in different regions of the U.S. The answer acknowledges the lack of explicit information and provides some context from the input.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the document does not explicitly mention whether the average throughput of oil in 98.233(j)(1) is an annual or daily average. However, the answer does not provide any specific analysis or calculation method to determine the average throughput of oil. The sentences are somewhat related but do not fit together perfectly and sound natural as a whole.",467,
54,How should the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks be determined to compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1)?,"The document provides information on the calculation methods for determining the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks based on the threshold of 10 barrels a day mentioned in 98.233.j(1). The relevant calculation methods are specified in paragraph (j) of section 98.233. Additionally, the document includes tables with default population emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and leaker emission factors for various equipment components. However, the specific calculation method or formula for determining the daily oil throughput based on the threshold of 10 barrels a day is not explicitly provided in the given text.","The daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks should be determined based on the Calculation Methods 1, 2, and 3 specified in paragraph (j) of the section 98.233. The threshold of 10 barrels a day mentioned in 98.233.j(1) is used to determine the appropriate calculation method for CH4 and CO2 emissions from the storage tanks.{

}","No, your RY2010 report reflects emissions as required by subparts A and C of the GHG Reporting Rule in effect at that time.  You do not need to make any changes to your RY2010 report to reflect the new requirements covered under 40 CFR subpart W.",,,5,The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It explicitly states that the transition from reporting under subpart C for RY2010 to reporting under subpart W for RY2011 for an onshore natural gas production facility does not require any changes to the RY2010 report. It also provides additional information on the importance of reviewing specific reporting requirements and calculation methods for subpart W to ensure compliance and accuracy in the RY2011 report.,4,0.3414634146,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any indication of uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear and coherent response to the question asked. It acknowledges that the document does not explicitly mention any changes that need to be made to the RY2010 report when transitioning from subpart C to subpart W for RY2011, but recommends reviewing the specific reporting requirements and calculation methods for subpart W to ensure compliance and accuracy in the RY2011 report.

}",Geologic provinces 160 (Appalachian Basin) and 160A (Appalachian Basin-Eastern Overthrust area) are two distinct basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production under Part 98.,,,5,"The answer directly states that geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered one basin for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, as all onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment associated with all wells in the basin are considered one facility.

The answer also provides additional information about the tables included in the input, which are relevant for understanding the environmental impact and regulatory considerations related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, as well as the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states, which may be relevant for understanding regional regulations and environmental factors affecting onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",962,
62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and regulate emissions from these facilities. This requirement is based on the understanding that emissions can vary significantly by geographic location. By reporting emissions data by basin, the EPA can better monitor and regulate the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production. This approach allows for more targeted and effective regulatory measures to mitigate the environmental impact of these activities. The provided tables contain population emission factors for different components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, which can be used to calculate and estimate emissions from these facilities in different basins. Additionally, the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states provides a geographical context for the regulatory reporting requirements, as emissions can vary between these regions.","The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and regulate emissions from these facilities.

}","When the GHGRP requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production were proposed, EPA’s goal was to provide a facility definition that all producers could directly apply, and that would be both practical and cost-effective.  EPA sought public comment on a range of possible options for defining the facility that would report with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, ranging from defining the facility at the individual well pad, to defining the facility at the field-level, to defining the facility at the basin-level.  Taking into account public comment, EPA finalized the definition of facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production using a basin-level approach because the operational boundaries and basin demarcations are clearly defined and are widely known, and the approach covered most emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. It correctly states that this requirement is based on the understanding that emissions can vary significantly by geographic location, and that reporting by basin allows for more targeted and effective regulatory measures to mitigate the environmental impact of these activities. The answer also correctly identifies the tables provided as containing population emission factors for different components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, which can be used to estimate emissions from these facilities in different basins. Finally, the answer correctly notes that the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states provides a geographical context for the regulatory reporting requirements, as emissions can vary between these regions.",4,0.3450980392,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,The answer is perfectly coherent as it provides a clear and concise explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. The answer also explains how this approach allows for more targeted and effective regulatory measures to mitigate the environmental impact of these activities. The provided tables and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states provide additional context and support for the answer.,1002,
63,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","The document provides several options for facilities to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring when a facility does not have a GOR value for a well. It suggests using Calculation Method 1 as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, which involves measuring the vented natural gas flow rate for any well in a unique tubing diameter group and pressure group combination that has not been previously measured. Additionally, if GOR from each well is not available, the document recommends using the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category. Furthermore, the document emphasizes the importance of accurately determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) of the hydrocarbon production from oil well(s) tested and the production rate from gas well(s) tested. The document also provides equations and methods for calculating annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading and during well completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing, as well as for well testing venting and flaring. The provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, which can be used in the calculation of emissions.","To determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring when a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, the document suggests using Calculation Method 1 as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, which involves measuring the vented natural gas flow rate for any well in a unique tubing diameter group and pressure group combination that has not been previously measured.

65,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my oil well operations to decide whether I need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing?,"The provided text contains a detailed discussion on various environmental regulations and calculations related to emissions from oil and gas operations. However, it does not directly address the question about determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations and the reporting requirements for completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing. The text primarily focuses on emission factors, population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and other calculations related to greenhouse gas emissions and hydrocarbon emissions from different components and equipment in the oil and gas industry. While the information provided is valuable for understanding environmental impact assessments and regulatory compliance, it does not specifically provide the necessary details for determining the gas to oil ratio or reporting emissions from completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing.","The text provides detailed information on how to determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, including the calculation methods, reporting requirements, and considerations for well venting during completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing. It mentions the calculation of GOR in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil, the procedures for delaying reporting of GOR data, and the use of default oil and gas compositions in software programs. Additionally, it discusses the calculation of annual mass emissions from glycol dehydrators, the calculation of CO2 emissions downstream of the storage tank from dissolved CO2 in hydrocarbon liquids produced through EOR operations, and the calculation of annual mass of CO2 sequestered in subsurface geologic formations. The text also covers the calculation of CH4 and CO2 emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks and the method for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from reciprocating compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities.{

While the information provided is valuable for understanding environmental impact assessments and regulatory compliance, it does not specifically provide the necessary details for determining the gas to oil ratio or reporting emissions from completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing.",910,
66,How should a gathering and boosting facility that previously reporting under Subpart C report in RY2016?,"The document provides detailed instructions for reporting emissions from a gathering and boosting facility, including the calculation methodologies and default values for various emission factors. It specifies the equations for calculating emissions based on fuel mass or volume, high heat value of the fuel, and fuel-specific CO2 emission factors. Additionally, it includes default average component counts for major equipment, population emission factors for different geographic locations, and leaker emission factors for various components. The document also provides default total hydrocarbon emission factors for natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground storage, as well as methane population emission factors for LNG storage. Therefore, the gathering and boosting facility should follow these guidelines and use the provided equations and default values to accurately report its emissions in RY2016.","The gathering and boosting facility, as defined in the text, includes gathering pipelines, compressors, process equipment, and other associated equipment used to collect and transport petroleum and/or natural gas. The facility must report the quantity of gas received in thousand standard cubic feet in the calendar year. Additionally, the facility must report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. The facility should also follow specific reporting requirements for different equipment types, production types, and geographic locations. The text provides detailed instructions for reporting emissions from various equipment and processes, including the use of specific calculation methodologies. Therefore, the gathering and boosting facility should follow these guidelines to accurately report its emissions in RY2016.{

}","The gathering and boosting system owner or operator can use a direct measurement of GOR through either onsite measurement or by sending samples out for laboratory analysis. The timing and duration of the sampling/measurement program should follow existing regulatory requirements, which include standard methods published by a consensus-based standards organization or industry standard practices. See 40 CFR 98.234(b). The EPA realizes that owners or operators may calculate GOR for other reasons such as documenting fluid quality for financial transactions, equipment optimization or other state/federal reporting requirements. These values can be used where appropriate.A825. 40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W does not prescribe a specific approach to calculate GOR. Gathering and boosting system operators may use the best approach for their facility, including direct measurement, calculation from other measured data, and standard estimation measures. We note that within the EPA’s 2016 updates to New Source Performance Standards for the oil and natural gas sector, GOR is defined as the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to a standard temperature and pressure.

}","Combustion emissions for the Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting segment are calculated using methods outlined in 40 CFR 98.233(z).

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O. The document also provides default emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. The emission factors are categorized based on different regions and equipment types. For example, the document includes emission factors for valve, connector, open-ended line, pressure relief valve, pneumatic pumps, and other components. These emission factors can be used in the calculation methods for reporting emissions from onshore natural gas processing. Additionally, the document provides average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering equipment, which can be used in conjunction with the emission factors to estimate vent emissions. The emission factors are also provided for leaker components and total hydrocarbon emissions, which can be used in the reporting of vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing.","Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O.

75,"If fuel gas lines are not owned or operated by a gas processing facility, but are on the gas processing facility property, do the fuel gas lines need to be monitored for equipment leaks?","The text provides information on default emission factors for various components and equipment in different gas services, such as gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression. It also includes population emission factors for different components in gas services, as well as leaker emission factors for different survey methods. The data covers a wide range of components including valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other equipment. The emission factors are provided for different survey methods, such as those specified in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). The information presented in the tables can be used to calculate the total hydrocarbon emissions and to determine whether fuel gas lines on the gas processing facility property need to be monitored for equipment leaks.","The fuel gas lines on the gas processing facility property need to be monitored for equipment leaks, as indicated by the requirement to calculate the annual average flow rate of fuel gas and the mention of equipment leaks from valves, pump seals, connectors, and other equipment leak sources in LNG service.{

77,Are facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams (and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane) subject to subpart W?,"The document provides detailed information about the regulations and calculations related to natural gas facilities. It mentions that facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W. It outlines the calculation methodology for estimating CO2 emissions from the complete combustion or oxidation of NGL products supplied. Additionally, it includes tables with population emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These tables provide emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps. The document also includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. It further provides default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage. The information in the document emphasizes the importance of accurate measurement and reporting of NGL quantities and emissions, as well as the use of specific calculation methods for different types of facilities and processes.","Facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W.

This information logically entails that such facilities are subject to subpart W, therefore the answer is logically true based on the information provided in the context.",1,0.0829493088,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise summary of the document, including the regulations and calculations related to natural gas facilities, the calculation methodology for estimating CO2 emissions, and the emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. The answer also includes information about default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S., as well as default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage. Overall, the answer is comprehensive and provides a thorough understanding of the document.",1358,
78,How should I calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids?,"The document provides information on how to calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. It states that the reporting threshold should be based on the annual volumes in Mscf of natural gas received for processing. Additionally, it mentions the use of GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities. However, the document does not provide specific equations or calculations for deriving the reporting threshold. It does include tables with population emission factors, default average component counts, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, which may be used in conjunction with the mentioned information to calculate the reporting threshold.","The reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater should be calculated based on the annual volumes in Mscf of natural gas received for processing.

}","The Rule states in §98.230(a) that the onshore natural gas processing industry includes all plants that fractionate, as well as all plants that do not fractionate that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.  Only those non-fractionating facilities with an annual average throughput of less than 25 MMscf per day would not be subject to reporting under subpart W even if the reporting threshold is triggered in Subpart C.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.",5,"The answer fully addresses the main aspects of the question and provides relevant information on how to calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids. It also mentions the use of GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities. The answer also acknowledges that the document does not provide specific equations or calculations for deriving the reporting threshold, but includes tables with population emission factors, default average component counts, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, which may be used in conjunction with the mentioned information to calculate the reporting threshold.",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how to calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids. It also mentions additional information about GHG mole fraction that may be useful in conjunction with the provided tables to calculate the reporting threshold.,2,0.3430962343,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how to calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids.

","However, please note that if, in year 2, your throughput capacity is less than 25 MMscf per day, you are not required to calculate and report GHG emissions from gas processing in year 2.  You would still be required to report other covered emissions at your facility.  This is because gas processing would not be an applicable segment for year 2.  Nevertheless, your facility would still be required to report in year 2, even if facility-wide emissions are less than 25,000mt CO2e, and would continue to report until you meet the criteria in 98.2(i) for ceasing to report.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.  This throughput is re-evaluated annually.  Once you are subject to the rule (e.g., your facility contains a source category listed in Table A-4), your facility must continue complying with all the requirements of this part, even if the facility does not meet the applicability requirements in a future year (i.e., 25,000 mtCO2e for petroleum and natural gas systems). The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3), which is the annual average throughput. It also correctly states that facilities with an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the industry segment. The answer acknowledges that the frequency of re-evaluating whether a facility falls below this threshold is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but this does not affect the accuracy of the information provided.",3,0.2333333333,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and mentions that facilities with an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the industry segment.

80,"Which takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility- the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) or the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3))?","The document mentioned the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year emission threshold in § 98.2(a)(2) and the throughput of 25 MMscf per day in relation to natural gas processing facilities. However, it does not directly specify which takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability. The provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and survey methods, but they do not directly address the precedence between the two thresholds. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the precedence based solely on the given input.","The 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year emission threshold in § 98.2(a)(2) is used to determine the applicability of reporting GHG emissions for facilities. Additionally, the throughput of 25 MMscf per day is mentioned in relation to natural gas processing facilities, which indicates its significance in determining applicability.{

It also discusses the estimation of fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used. The text details the calculation methodology, calculation methods for various scenarios, and the use of equations for different types of emissions. Additionally, it includes information on the use of gas composition analyzers, calculation of input gas consumption, and the development of apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N2O consumption. The document also covers the calculation of emissions from well venting during completions and workovers, calculation of emissions from stack systems, and the calculation of total annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG emitted by electronics manufacturing production processes from each fab.","The document contains information on the calculation of GHG volumetric emissions from flaring at standard conditions using Equations W-19 and W-20.

","EPA agrees that in the event that it is not possible to distinguish the source streams from the processing facility being flared, whether being located upstream or downstream of the demethanizer, or being a hydrocarbon product stream, reporters may use engineering calculations based on process knowledge and best available data.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question. It does not address whether engineering calculations can be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product.,1,"The answer does not provide a direct answer to the question asked about using engineering calculations for flare gas composition in Equations W-19 through W-21. It only provides information on the calculation methodology, methods for various scenarios, and the use of equations for different types of emissions, which is not relevant to the question asked.",1,0.0736196319,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides relevant information on the calculation methodology, methods for various scenarios, and the use of equations for different types of emissions. It also includes information on the use of gas composition analyzers, calculation of input gas consumption, and the development of apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N2O consumption.

82,"Does the onshore natural gas processing source category include the dehydrator or ""knockout pot"" in the example?","The onshore natural gas processing source category does include dehydrators, which are mentioned in the text as equipment used in the separation of natural gas liquids. The text also specifies that for onshore natural gas processing facilities, the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas must be used for all emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control. Additionally, the text mentions that for onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas liquid must be used for all streams. The annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater is also specified as a criterion for inclusion in the onshore natural gas processing segment. The tables provided include default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, as well as default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing. These tables can be used to calculate emissions from the onshore natural gas processing source category, including dehydrators, by using the component counts and emission factors specified in the tables.","The onshore natural gas processing source category includes dehydrators, which are mentioned in the text as equipment used in the separation of natural gas liquids.

}","98.232 (d) states that “for onshore natural gas processing, report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the following sources”.  For example, if the compressor stream is 100% propane then the emissions will not include CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions and therefore will not have to be reported under subpart W.  However, if the facility exceeds the 25,000 mtCO2e threshold then the owner or operator must report combustion emissions for this compressor under subpart C.",2,"The answer mostly lacks relevance as it does not directly address the question of whether we are required to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane. Instead, it provides information about the requirement to include owned or operated residue gas compression equipment under subpart W for natural gas processing facilities, the definition of natural gas processing, different types of compressors and their associated emissions, and the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service.",1,"The answer does not provide a clear and direct answer to the question. It mentions the absence of a specific mention of the requirement to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane, but it does not provide a definitive answer to the question.",1,0.2711864407,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The methods for monitoring tank emissions are specified in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1). Method 98.233(k) requires monitoring the tank vapor vent stack annually for emissions using specified methods, while method 98.234(a)(1) requires continuous monitoring of the flow rate, CH4 concentration, temperature, pressure, and moisture content. Intermittent emissions from the storage tank can be treated by calculating the weekly CH4 liberated from the mine using CH4 measured weekly or more frequently, CH4 content, flow rate, temperature, pressure, and moisture content. An alternative method to quantify the emissions can be used if it complies with the requirements specified in the regulations. The document also provides default population emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and services, which can be used in the quantification of emissions. Additionally, it includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, as well as the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference. These tables and factors can be utilized to calculate and quantify emissions as per the given regulations.","The methods for monitoring tank emissions are specified in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1).

                   ","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the difference between the two methods for monitoring tank emissions, as well as how intermittent emissions from the storage tank can be treated and the possibility of using alternative methods to quantify emissions. The answer also mentions the availability of default population emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and services, as well as average component counts for major equipment and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference, which shows a comprehensive understanding of the regulations and their application.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, how intermittent emissions from the storage tank can be treated, and whether an alternative method can be used to quantify the emissions. The answer also mentions the availability of default population emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and services, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference.

It also includes detailed tables with population emission factors, default average component counts, leaker emission factors, and total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression. The tables provide specific emission factors for different components and survey methods, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meters, and other components. These factors are essential for calculating emissions from onshore natural gas transmission compression, as they provide the necessary data for the emission estimation process.",1,"The answer does not follow logically from the information contained in the context. The context defines onshore natural gas transmission compression as 'any stationary combination of compressors that move natural gas from production fields, natural gas processing plants, or other transmission compressors through transmission pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage.' There is no mention of combustion in the definition, so the answer is logically false.",1,0.095890411,1,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the onshore natural gas transmission compression, including the equipment and activities to be reported, the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, and the calculation methods and emission factors to be used for reporting.

89,How does a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability?,"The document provides information on how a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determines subpart applicability. It mentions that the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment, natural gas dehydrators, natural gas compressors, electrical generators, steam boilers, and process heaters are reported under the subpart. Additionally, it discusses the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service. The document also outlines the calculation methods for volumetric GHG emissions from reciprocating compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. Furthermore, it provides tables with default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression. These tables contain specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment and activities, which can be used to determine subpart applicability based on the type of equipment and activities specified in the relevant paragraphs.","A natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability based on the type of equipment and activities specified in the relevant paragraphs.

92,How do we report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir?,"The document provides detailed information on reporting emissions from various facilities, including underground natural gas storage. It outlines the criteria for defining a facility, the types of equipment and activities to be reported, and the calculation methods for estimating emissions. The document also mentions the use of default emission factors and the need to comply with specific reporting standards. However, it does not explicitly address how to report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir. The document contains tables with default emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities. These emission factors can be used in the calculation methods for estimating emissions. For example, the document provides emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and other components. It also includes information on the average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities, as well as crude oil production equipment. Additionally, the document specifies population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage. These factors can be used in the calculation methods for estimating emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir.","The text provides detailed definitions and requirements for reporting emissions from various facilities, including underground natural gas storage, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities.

93,Could EPA clarify that the natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W?,"The text provides detailed descriptions of various aspects related to natural gas storage, processing, and transportation. It explains the characteristics and operations of LNG storage, underground natural gas storage, natural gas processing, and onshore natural gas transmission compression. It also mentions specific calculation methods for estimating emissions from different sources, such as onshore production storage tanks and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks. However, it does not explicitly address the specific scenario of natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not explicitly clarified whether such storage should be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W. The document also includes tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions, which can be used for estimating emissions from different sources.","The text provides detailed definitions and descriptions of various aspects related to natural gas storage, processing, and transportation.

96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"The text mentions that underground natural gas storage facilities must use appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4A to this subpart. However, it does not provide different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment. The provided tables include default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, which specify emission factors for storage stations and storage wellheads. These factors include emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meters, and other components. The absence of different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components in the context of natural gas storage facilities suggests that the regulations do not differentiate between these components when determining emission factors, unlike the approach taken for the natural gas transmission segment.","The text mentions that underground natural gas storage facilities must use appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4A to this subpart. However, it does not provide different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment. It also provides information on the annual volume of natural gas placed into storage, withdrawn from storage, and the GHG mole fraction in natural gas stored. The text also specifies the calculation methods for CH4 and CO2 emissions from storage tanks, but it does not address different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components.{

Reporting starts when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage. The document also mentions the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads, calculation methods for GHG emissions, and the use of GHG mole fraction in natural gas stored in the underground natural gas storage industry segment. The provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as emission factors for natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage. These tables can be used to calculate emissions during the salt dome mining process and natural gas storage activities as required by Subpart W.","Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility.

}",Under 98.230(a)(5) reporting is only required for “…salt dome caverns that store natural gas…” Methane emissions from building of a storage facility are not included in the reporting for subpart W.  Emissions reporting is required when the storage facility is operational.,5,"The answer addresses all the main aspects of the question and provides additional relevant information about Subpart W requirements, default emission factors, and component counts for natural gas production and gathering equipment. The answer is comprehensive and accurate, and it demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic.",5,The answer clearly states that Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility. It also mentions that reporting starts when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage. The provided context supports this answer by discussing the requirements for reporting emissions during the salt dome mining process and natural gas storage activities as required by Subpart W.,3,0.2181818182,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise response to the question. It also includes additional relevant information about default emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as emission factors for natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage. This information can be used to calculate emissions during the salt dome mining process and natural gas storage activities as required by Subpart W.",904,

}","LNG facilities will not be surveying the valves, connectors, and other components that are in Gas Service under 98.233(q).  At an LNG facility, a compressor that recovers vapor, but is designed so that it does not have reportable emissions of methane-containing gas, such as a flooded screw compressor, or one with seals purged with pressurized nitrogen, will not be reported, in accordance with the rule and the EPA’s response in Response to Public Comments, EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1026-7 (see pp. 45-46 in http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part1.pdf).  Vapor recovery compressors use a population emission factor, hence there is no leak detection required.  Reporters have to count the number of vapor recovery compressors and use the population emission factor.",3,"The answer partially addresses the main aspects of the question by providing information about the equipment required to be reported if found to be leaking. However, it does not directly answer whether only the equipment listed in Table W-5 is required to be reported as defined in the rule. The answer also provides additional information about emission factors and population emission factors for various components in gas service, which may be useful for further analysis.",1,"The given information does not directly state whether only the equipment listed in Table W-5 (Vapor Recovery Compressor) is required to be reported if it is found to be leaking. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",2,0.3627906977,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides relevant information about emission factors and population emission factors for various components in gas service, which can be used to calculate emissions from leaking equipment. It also mentions the equipment listed in Table W-5 (Vapor Recovery Compressor) as the only required reporting for leaking equipment, although it does not directly state the specific requirement for reporting.",811,

}","To answer the second question about pressure relief valves, Sections 98.233(q)(6) and (7) state that emission factors for “…equipment leaks detected from valves, pump seals, connectors, and other” shall be used from Tables W-5 and W-6 in the rule. A pressure relief valve is a special type of valve and falls in the category of ""other,"" so this emission source is included in the leak detection survey and required to be reported.  Regarding your first question: sections 98.232(g) and 98.232(h) do no include venting from LNG storage tanks as an emission source; therefore venting emissions from LNG storage tank are not required for LNG storage or for LNG import and export equipment.  However, if the LNG storge tank is blown down to atmosphere, then section 98.232(h) does require reporting.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate summary of the document's information about the regulations and requirements for reporting emissions from various sources in the LNG storage and import/export industry, including the calculation methods for deriving emissions from different equipment components, the use of default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components, and the procedures and standards for quantifying emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals.",5,"The answer provides a clear and direct confirmation that the document outlines the procedures and standards for quantifying emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals, which implies that the emissions from such sources need to be calculated.",3,0.3398058252,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise response to the question, outlining the regulations and requirements for reporting emissions from various sources in the LNG storage and import/export industry.

It explains the definition of LNG, LNG storage, and offshore petroleum and natural gas production. The process of regasifying LNG, vaporization units, and the handling of natural gas at offshore platforms is also discussed. Additionally, it covers the reporting requirements for various equipment and activities related to natural gas production and transmission. However, specific numbers related to the offshore LNG terminal or the emissions from the described process are not explicitly mentioned in the text. The provided tables include default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, as well as onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression. These tables can be used to calculate the emissions from specific components and activities, which may be applicable to the offshore LNG terminal scenario described in the question.","The text provides detailed information about LNG import and export equipment, onshore and offshore natural gas transmission, natural gas processing, and gathering and boosting.

The process of regasifying LNG, vaporization units, and the handling of natural gas at offshore platforms is also discussed. Additionally, it covers the reporting requirements for various equipment and activities related to natural gas production and transmission.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information.",2,0.2710843373,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the answer does not explicitly address the specific question about reporting emissions for LNG storage sites located adjacent to subpart D facilities under 'common control', it provides equations and explanations for calculating emissions and includes tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions that can be used to determine emission factors for specific equipment at LNG storage sites and subpart D facilities.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing the definition of 'facility' with respect to natural gas distribution and onshore petroleum and natural gas production, and explaining that it includes all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or common control. However, the answer does not explicitly state whether the LDC or the subpart D facility should report the emissions under subpart D or subpart W for LNG storage sites located adjacent to subpart D facilities under 'common control'.",1611,
108,"For a liquefied natural gas import facility, do boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported?","The document mentioned detailed information about the calculation methods for various emissions, including LNG storage facilities, well venting for liquids unloading, blowdown vent stacks, and equipment leaks. It also specifies the need to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources, including LNG storage facilities and well venting for liquids unloading. The document outlines the methods for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks and natural gas pneumatic device venting. Additionally, it provides tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different scenarios, such as onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, natural gas processing plants, transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage. These tables include emission factors for components like valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and others. The emission factors are provided for different survey methods, such as § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). Based on this information, it is clear that boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported, and the document provides insights into the calculation methods and reporting requirements for such emissions.","Based on the information provided, it is clear that boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported.

}","For natural gas distribution, a facility, which is the collection of all distribution pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by an LDC, is required to do at least one facility wide leak detection survey per calendar year and has the option to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys; if the facility selects this option, the additional facility-wide survey(s) must be completed during the same calendar year in order to account for fixing one or more leaks in the annual GHG report.  If the facility chooses to fix one or more leaks and conduct another survey to determine that the component is not leaking, it must conduct a facility wide leak detection survey in order to account for fixing the leak(s) in the annual GHG report.  As leaks are random in nature and while some leaks are fixed others are likely to occur.  Therefore, a comprehensive survey is the only statistically relevant manner by which to establish facility-wide leak emissions rates and account for leaks repaired.  Please see the response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1014-9 (Response to Comments, pp. 1281-1282, http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf) for further details.  It is very important to note that the requirement to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys should a company wish to account for fixing a leak does not preclude in any way a company from repairing a leak.  If a company chooses to conduct only one facility-wide leak detection survey in a calendar year but finds a leak during the survey, the company can and is encouraged to fix the leak.  The leak detected though, as noted above, must be reported as a leaker for the entire calendar year should the company choose not to conduct a second survey.",,,5,The answer states that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year and that the number of surveys to be conducted in a year is not explicitly specified and does not need to be indicated in advance. This is in line with the information provided in the context.,2,0.38647343,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear explanation of the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys in a calendar year. It also mentions the flexibility for facilities to conduct multiple surveys as needed and provides additional details on leak detection methods, equipment survey requirements, and reporting obligations. The answer also references the provided tables containing default emission factors and component counts for different regions, which can be used in the calculation methodology for equipment leak emissions.",1177,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"The document outlines the requirements for conducting equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations, including the option to conduct surveys over multiple years not exceeding a five-year period. It also specifies the approval criteria and timing for requesting extensions for using best available monitoring methods. Additionally, it details the calculation of emission factors based on annual equipment leak surveys and the conditions for submitting proposed MRV plans to the EPA. However, it does not explicitly address the possibility of EPA providing a sunset provision for annual leak surveys based on the scenario described in the question. The document also provides various tables and equations related to emission factors, population emission factors, and component counts for different equipment and services in the petroleum and natural gas industry. These tables and equations can be used to calculate emissions and assess the impact of annual leak surveys on environmental regulations. However, there is no specific mention of a sunset provision for annual leak surveys in the provided information.","The document outlines the requirements for conducting equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations, including the option to conduct surveys over multiple years not exceeding a five-year period.

}","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",,,1,"The answer states that the specific distribution mentioned in the question is not directly addressed in the provided content, which is consistent with the context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information, and the score is 1.",2,0.2268656716,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,2,"The answer mostly lacks coherence. While it provides some relevant information about monitoring plans, it does not directly address the specific distribution mentioned in the question. Additionally, it jumps between discussing monitoring for abatement systems and equipment, without clearly connecting the two topics or providing a cohesive explanation of how they relate to the question at hand.",458,
113,What types of instruments are permissible for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W?,"The document mentions the permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W. These instruments include Method 21, equipment leak detection methods in appendix A–7 to part 60 of this chapter, acoustic leak detection device, optical gas imaging instrument, and infrared laser beam illuminated instrument. Method 21 specifies that a leak is detected if an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured. The acoustic leak detection device is used to detect through-valve leakage, and a leak is detected if a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated. The optical gas imaging instrument is used for inaccessible source types, and a leak is designated if 10,000 ppm or greater is measured. Additionally, the infrared laser beam illuminated instrument is used for equipment leak detection, and a leak is designated if 10,000 ppm or greater is measured. The document also provides various calculation methodologies for equipment leak emissions and the reporting of survey information for equipment leaks. It includes equations for emission factors, molar volume conversion factor, ratio of molecular weights, conversion factors for various units, and mass of emitted gases from process vents. Furthermore, the document contains tables with population emission factors for different regions, default average component counts for major equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage.","The permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include Method 21, equipment leak detection methods in appendix A–7 to part 60 of this chapter, acoustic leak detection device, optical gas imaging instrument, and infrared laser beam illuminated instrument.

","With regards to acid gas injection wells and subparts PP and UU, please see the response to EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-0582-31 in the Response to Comments (pages 1474 - 1476) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf.  EPA requires reporters to calculate emissions from AGR units and then adjust them downwards by the amount transferred outside of the facility.  Therefore, if 100% of the CO2 recovered from an AGR unit is transferred outside of the facility, then CO2 emissions from the AGR unit must be calculated prior to determining the amount being transferred outside the facility.  Note that §98.236(c)(3) requires separate reporting of both the AGR emissions and emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility, even if the values are the same.",,,1,"The provided input does not explicitly state whether the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero if all emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside of the facility. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",2,0.3428571429,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the specific information regarding whether the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero if all emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside of the facility is not explicitly stated in the provided input, the answer provides relevant information about the document's content and calculation methods for determining CO2 emissions from different equipment and components in the petroleum and natural gas industry.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the specific information regarding whether the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero if all emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside of the facility is not explicitly stated in the provided input. However, the answer does not provide a clear and definitive answer to the question.",586,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"Facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. The document provides information on the calculation methods for estimating CO2 emissions from the acid gas removal unit, including the use of Equations W–4A and W–4B, and the use of continuous gas analyzers or quarterly gas samples for monitoring. It also mentions the reporting requirements for the annual quantity of CO2 recovered and transferred outside the facility under subpart PP of this part. Additionally, the document includes several tables providing default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, and default methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. These tables can be used to calculate and estimate emissions as per the regulatory requirements.","Facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.

125,Will EPA approve the use of BAMM relating to the measurement of isolation valves at compressors in the shut down depressurized mode that are to be measured at least once every three calendar years?,"The document specifies the requirements for measuring volumetric emissions from isolation valve leakage at compressors in not-operating-depressurized-mode. It outlines the frequency of measurement, stating that it must be done at least once in any three consecutive calendar years, provided it can be taken during a scheduled shutdown. If there is no scheduled shutdown within three consecutive calendar years, the measurement must be taken at the next scheduled depressurized shutdown. The requirement does not apply if the compressor has blind flanges in place throughout the reporting year. Additionally, the document provides methods for performing as found measurements from individual centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources, and it outlines the general requirements for conducting volumetric emission measurements on each centrifugal and reciprocating compressor. The document also includes various tables with emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression, as well as underground natural gas storage and LNG storage. These tables provide detailed emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components, along with the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference.","The document specifies that for compressors measured in not-operating-depressurized-mode, volumetric emissions from isolation valve leakage must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years, provided the measurement can be taken during a scheduled shutdown.

 ","Pursuant to a May 2013 final rule, Subpart W BAMM requests are due by June 30 of the year prior to the year in which reports are due (the “reporting year”) and for which BAMM is sought.  As June 30, 2013 falls on a weekend, BAMM requests for the 2014 reporting year are due by July 1, 2013.  The totality of the circumstances related to conducting isolation valve measurement on compressors in shutdown depressurized mode if fully explained in a proper Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) request may be considered by EPA to constitute unique or unusual circumstances justifying the use of BAMM.",,,5,"The document clearly specifies the requirements for measuring volumetric emissions from isolation valve leakage at compressors in not-operating-depressurized-mode. It outlines the frequency of measurement, stating that it must be done at least once in any three consecutive calendar years, provided it can be taken during a scheduled shutdown. If there is no scheduled shutdown within three consecutive calendar years, the measurement must be taken at the next scheduled depressurized shutdown. The requirement does not apply if the compressor has blind flanges in place throughout the reporting year. The document also provides methods for performing as found measurements from individual centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources, and it outlines the general requirements for conducting volumetric emission measurements on each centrifugal and reciprocating compressor. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",1,0.1851851852,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the requirements for measuring volumetric emissions from isolation valve leakage at compressors in not-operating-depressurized-mode. It also mentions the frequency of measurement and the conditions under which the requirement does not apply. Additionally, it highlights the availability of methods for performing as found measurements and outlines the general requirements for conducting volumetric emission measurements on each centrifugal and reciprocating compressor. The answer also mentions the various tables with emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression, as well as underground natural gas storage and LNG storage, which provide detailed emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components, along with the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific information on BAMM and its potential use in relation to the measurement of isolation valves at compressors in the shut down depressurized mode.",1388,
126,Will EPA approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of individual compressor vents routed a common manifold?,"The document provides comprehensive guidance on the monitoring and measurement of emissions from manifolded compressor sources, including centrifugal and reciprocating compressors. It outlines methods for conducting volumetric emission measurements, continuous monitoring, and as-found measurements for individual compressor sources and manifolded groups of compressor sources. It also specifies calculation methods for volumetric GHG emissions from continuous monitoring and as-found measurements. The document also mentions the use of a common vent for routing gas from multiple compressors and the requirement for conducting measurements at the common vent stack. However, it does not explicitly mention the approval of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold. Therefore, based on the provided information, it cannot be conclusively determined whether EPA will approve the use of Subpart W BAMM for the specified scenario.","The text provides detailed information about the measurement and monitoring of manifolded compressor sources, including centrifugal and reciprocating compressors.

Additionally, it mentions the use of continuous flow measurement devices and the calculation of flare gas emissions based on flow volumes. The document also includes tables with default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering/boosting facilities in both the Eastern and Western U.S. These tables can be used to calculate emissions from various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps. The provided emission factors and component counts can be utilized in the calculation of emissions from compressor sources routed to flares, which may be relevant to the approval of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) by the EPA.","The document contains detailed information about the measurement and reporting of emissions from compressor sources routed to flares, including specific requirements for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from centrifugal and reciprocating compressors.

It also mentions specific environmental terms such as dehydrator absorbent circulation rate, closed-loop system, wet natural gas, and dehydrator vents. Additionally, it outlines the requirements for reporting information related to different types of dehydrators based on their natural gas throughput. However, the document does not explicitly mention dehydrators used to dry a liquid stream, so it does not directly address the question about whether such dehydrators meet the definition provided.","The text provides a detailed definition of a dehydrator as a device that uses a liquid absorbent to directly contact a natural gas stream to absorb water vapor.
