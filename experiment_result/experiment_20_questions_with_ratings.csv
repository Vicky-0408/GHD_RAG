16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting differ between transmission compression and underground storage due to the specific reporting requirements for each segment.

On the other hand, for underground storage, the vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting are reported in standard cubic feet of CO2 per operational hour of all meter/regulator cells that place fluids underground for storage or disposal, as specified in § 98.233(g)(2). The difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting in the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets for transmission compression and underground storage may also be attributed to the specific characteristics and operational conditions of the equipment in each category.

Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"Based on the information provided, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not provide a sunset provision for annual leak surveys even if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components.

We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period.

Natural gas processi The magnesium production and processing source category consists of the following processes:, (a) Any process in which magnesium metal is produced through smelting (including electrolytic g with non-compressor emission sources., (5) Onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. Centrifugal compressors with wet rating unit., (3) Ethanol plant., (4) Pulp and paper mill., (5) Natural gas processing., (6) Gasification operations., (7) Other anthropogenic source.,  e onshore petroleum and natural gas production and the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segments, a different name or ID may be used for a single dehydrator for each l leum and natural gas gathering and boosting)., (B) The number of atmospheric tanks in the sub-basin (for onshore production) or county (for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boos Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting)., (B) The number of atmospheric tanks in the sub-basin (for onshore production) or county (for onshore petroleum and natural gas gath art of the petrochemical production source category., (c) A facility that makes methanol, hydrogen, and/or ammonia from synthesis gas is part of the petrochemical source category if the annual .35, and any recordkeeping requirements specified in § 98.37., (ii) Emissions from fuel combusted in stationary or portable equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities on pipelines vented within the facility boundary), compressors, scrubbers/strainers, pig launchers and receivers, emergency shutdowns (this category includes emergency shutdown blowdown emissions rega eum and natural gas production operations and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting operations in the facility perform the following activities:, (A) Count all major equipme in the oil formation. All emission sources that handle condensate from gas wells in high permeability gas, shale gas, or tight gas reservoir rock formations are considered to be in the formation that thering and boosting, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment, indicate whether you elected to comply with § 98. ions., (3) Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must also report the information specified in paragra rce types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304., (1) Offshore production facilities under BOEMR ther industry segment defined in this subpart., Facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production for purposes of reporting under this subpart and for the corresponding nizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities. For onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, use the GHG mole fraction in feed on for each equipment or event type. For industry segments other than onshore natural gas transmission pipeline, equipment or event types must be grouped into the following seven categories: Facility facilities. For onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, use the GHG mole percent in feed natural gas liquid for all streams. If you have a continuous gas compos nd sub-basin category), where gas wells are vented to the atmosphere to expel liquids accumulated in the tubing, install a recording flow meter on the vent line used to vent gas from the well (e.g. n § 98.238. Where a person or entity owns or operates more than one well in a basin, then all onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment associated with all wells that the person or entity ocess that solely distills or recycles waste solvent that contains a petrochemical is not part of the petrochemical production source category. tegory does not consist of the following facilities:, (1) Field gathering and boosting stations., (2) Natural gas processing plants that separate NGLs from natural gas and produce bulk holes where coal bed gas is emitted, and those where the gas is sold, used onsite, or otherwise destroyed (including by flaring)., (c) This source category does not include abandoned or closed ce hydrogen by reforming, gasification, oxidation, reaction, or other transformations of feedstocks., (c) This source category includes merchant hydrogen production facilities located within a rted to a natural gas processing facility, a natural gas transmission pipeline, a natural gas distribution pipeline, or another gathering and boosting facility in the calendar year, in thousand standa also includes all residue gas compression equipment owned or operated by the natural gas processing plant. This industry segment includes processing plants that fractionate gas liquids, and processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater., (4) Onshore natural gas transmission compression. Onshore natural gas ","Yes, emergency flares are covered under the general category of flares.  For reporting purposes, in the final rule, EPA reduced the burden associated with the flare monitoring and reporting requirements by allowing the use of engineering calculations based on process knowledge, company records, and best available data for estimating flow volumes and gas compositions.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, addressing both the onshore production and gas processing source categories. It also includes additional relevant information about the reporting requirements for stationary and portable combustion emissions and residue gas compression equipment. Overall, the answer is comprehensive and directly relevant to the question asked.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, citing the specific requirements for reporting emissions from flares under both the onshore production and gas processing source categories. The answer also includes additional details about the types of facilities included in these source categories and the specific emissions that must be reported.",4,0.2179487179,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise response to the question, citing relevant information from Subpart W and explaining the reporting requirements for emissions from flares at gas processing facilities and well pads. The answer also includes additional details about the source categories and the types of emissions that must be reported, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the topic.",782
