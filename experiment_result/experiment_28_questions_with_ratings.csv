}","Subpart W of part 98 requires petroleum and natural gas facilities to report annual methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from equipment leaks and venting, and emissions of CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) from flaring, onshore production stationary and portable combustion emissions, and combustion emissions from stationary equipment involved in natural gas distribution. Facilities covered by this rule might also be required to report emissions under other subparts of the GHG Reporting Program, if applicable.  The GHG Reporting Program requires reporting of GHG emissions: CO2, CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated GHGs: hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases.  These gases are often expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e).",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate summary of the GHG emissions covered under the rule, including the specific types of emissions that offshore facilities, onshore gathering and boosting facilities, and onshore natural gas transmission pipeline facilities are required to report. The answer also correctly identifies the relevant sections of the regulations (30 CFR 250.302 through 304) and provides a clear and concise summary of the emission factors and equations included in the provided text.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate summary of the GHG emissions covered under the rule, as well as the various emission factors and equations used in emissions calculations.

4,Do the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements?,"The facility definitions in the mentioned rule have a significant impact on EPA reporting requirements for various industries and equipment types. The definition of 'facility' encompasses a wide range of physical properties, plants, equipment, and structures that emit or may emit greenhouse gases, including specific criteria for electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting systems, carbon dioxide production wells, and natural gas distribution. It also outlines reporting obligations for different types of facilities such as petroleum refineries, pulp and paper manufacturing, and electrical equipment manufacturing and refurbishing facilities. Furthermore, the rule specifies reporting requirements at the facility level based on the total nameplate capacity of SF6 and PFC containing equipment, affecting other EPA reporting requirements across different regions in the U.S. Additionally, the provided equations and tables offer detailed insights into emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and facilities, further emphasizing the impact of the facility definitions on EPA reporting requirements.","Yes, the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements.

petroleum and natural gas systems source category is defined as including petroleum refineries, importers, exporters of petroleum products, natural gas liquids fractionators, local natural gas distribution companies, and various specific sources at petroleum refineries such as catalytic cracking units, fluid coking units, delayed coking units, catalytic reforming units, coke calcining units, and more. It also includes facilities that produce hydrogen gas, offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and facilities that produce fluorinated GHGs, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated HTFs. The source category encompasses a wide range of emission source types and has specific reporting requirements based on the type, service, and geographic location. The emissions data for petroleum and natural gas emissions sources must be quality assured as applicable.{

}","Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year must report. The rule defines three different types of facilities. You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive list of what oil and natural gas system facilities must report under subpart W, including CO2 and CH4 emissions from various sources, as well as population emission factors and average component counts for major equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",1,0.1921921922,1,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive list of who must report under subpart W, without any indication of uncertainty or lack of knowledge.",4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of who must report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems). It also includes additional information on population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. However, there are some technical terms and acronyms used that may not be familiar to all readers, which slightly affects the coherence of the answer.",1091,
8,What gases must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities?,"Oil and natural gas system facilities must report emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and other fluorinated greenhouse gases as defined in the regulations. Additionally, the emissions data for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing facilities, as well as natural gas transmission, compression, and storage facilities, are provided in the tables. These include emission factors, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for different types of equipment and components. The data covers both Eastern and Western U.S. regions and includes information on methane emission factors for LNG storage, LNG import and export equipment, and natural gas distribution. The emission factors provided in the tables are essential for understanding and reporting the greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas system facilities.","Oil and natural gas system facilities must report emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and other fluorinated greenhouse gases as defined in the regulations.{

nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and other fluorinated greenhouse gases as defined in the regulations. The emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from various processes and units within the facility must be calculated and reported in metric tons of each pollutant emitted. Additionally, the total annual emissions across fluorinated GHGs for the entire facility, expressed in metric tons of CO2e, need to be calculated and reported. The specific equations and parameters for these calculations are specified in the regulations.{

}","Under this rule, facilities will detect, as applicable, and calculate GHG emissions according to the specified quantification methods. See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question about how greenhouse gas emissions are calculated for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities.

However, the specific start date for reporting under subpart W is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Additionally, relevant data such as default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression are available for further analysis and reference.","The reporting for subpart W mentions the use of substitute data procedures, retention of laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets for estimating CO2 emissions, adherence to QA/QC methods, and reporting alternatives for units using the four Tiers.

Similarly, newly subject facilities can also use best engineering estimates for the first 6 months.

Additionally, the provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting equipment, as well as crude oil production equipment. The tables also include designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states, leaker emission factors for various survey methods, total hydrocarbon emission factors for natural gas processing and transmission compression, and population emission factors for natural gas transmission compression. These factors and counts can be utilized for emissions estimation and compliance under subpart W.","The subpart W allows facilities that are currently subject to it and acquire new sources from another facility to use best engineering estimates for any data related to those newly acquired sources for the first 6 months of required data collection.

How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The specific operating factor value for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities is not provided in the available text. However, the tables provide emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic devices. These factors vary based on the region, with different values for the Eastern and Western U.S. Additionally, the tables also include average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. These tables can be used to assess the environmental impact and emissions from the production facilities. To correlate the operating factor with the barrels of crude oil produced, further details or specific equations relating the operating factor to crude oil production are required.","The operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must be reported, as specified in the relevant paragraphs of the section. However, the specific operating factor value is not mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, further details on the operating factor value are required to correlate it with the barrels of crude oil produced.{

}","EPA has provided guidance on the operating factor in the Notes section, where it states, “This is defined as the fraction of time the process unit is operating in a calendar year.  For example, a 90% operating factor would be entered as 0.9 because the unit is in operation for 90% of the year.”",,,1,The answer does not provide a clear correlation between the operating factor for associated gas venting and the barrels of crude oil produced. It only mentions that further details or specific equations are required to establish this correlation.,2,0.1828571429,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the specific operating factor value for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons is not provided, the answer provides emission factors for various components and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. This information can be used to assess the environmental impact and emissions from the production facilities.",4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides relevant information about the emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, and how they vary based on the region. It also mentions the average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. However, it acknowledges that further details or specific equations are required to correlate the operating factor with the barrels of crude oil produced.",970,
14,Where can I find the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production can be found by analyzing a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or each county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. Additionally, it involves determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) of the hydrocarbon production from oil well(s) tested and the production rate from gas well(s) tested. The tool also requires using the best available monitoring methods for measurement data and reporting the component type, service type, and geographic location for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. Furthermore, detailed emission factors and component counts for major equipment in different regions of the U.S. are available for assessing the environmental impact and facilitating compliance with regulations related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering.","The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production can be found by analyzing a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or each county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting.

15,Does EPA offer guidance on how to estimate a worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for purpose of determining applicability?,"Yes, the EPA does offer comprehensive guidance on estimating worst-case scenario GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability. The guidance includes detailed calculation methods for annual CH4 and CO2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks. It involves using operating conditions, flashing emissions calculation with specific software programs, and determining parameters for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data. Additionally, the guidance covers the calculation of emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage, atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks, and transmission-distribution transfer stations. The EPA's guidance provides a thorough framework for estimating worst-case scenario GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks. Furthermore, the provided tables offer default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, methane population emission factors, methane leaker emission factors, and methane emission factors for natural gas distribution, all of which can be utilized in estimating GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks.","Yes, EPA offers guidance on how to estimate a worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability.

16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage is due to specific reporting and calculation requirements for each segment. For transmission compression, the calculation of CH4 and CO2 annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage is specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of the section. On the other hand, for underground natural gas storage, the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4B to this subpart are used. This difference reflects the distinct regulatory and measurement methodologies for the two segments.","In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting because they fall under different segments with specific requirements. For transmission compression, the calculation of CH4 and CO2 annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage is specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of the section, while for underground natural gas storage, the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4B to this subpart are used. Therefore, the difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting is due to the specific reporting and calculation requirements for each segment.{

","You are correct that on April 25, 2011, EPA finalized a rule extending the deadline for submission of a request to use BAMM until July 31, 2011 (76 FR 22825).  On June 27, 2011, a proposed rule was published in the Federal Register that would allow automatic use of BAMM for the entire 2011 reporting year for emissions sources covered under subpart W (Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems) without seeking approval from EPA (76 FR 37300).  The public comment period for the proposed rule will be open through July 27, 2011.  Given the timing necessary to consider public comment and finalize the rule, EPA will not be able to promulgate the final rule by July 31, 2011.  Please note that 40 CFR 98.234(f)(1) indicates that ""If the reporter anticipates the potential need for best available monitoring for sources for which they need to petition EPA and the situation is unresolved at the time of the deadline, reporters should submit written notice of this potential situation to EPA by the specified deadline for requests to be considered.""  EPA agrees that as of July 31, 2011, the circumstances surrounding the applicability of the deadline will be ""unresolved"" and that submitting a notification of intent would satisfy the rule requirements.",,,5,"The answer directly states that the proposed amendments to subpart W issued on June 20, 2011, that delay the due date for BAMM extension requests to December 31, 2011, will not be finalized before the existing deadline in the rule of July 31, 2011.

It also outlines specific reporting requirements for facilities that become subject to the rule due to physical or operational changes. Additionally, it addresses the submission of complete reporting year GHG reports for specific years and the retention of laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used to estimate emissions. The rule also allows for reporting alternatives for units using the four Tiers and provides guidelines for reporting gas volumes at standard conditions. Furthermore, there are detailed population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and leaker emission factors for various components related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. The data also includes information on the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states, as well as population emission factors for underground natural gas storage and LNG storage.

The rule stipulates what standard temperature and pressure are, but how, for an annual average, is actual temperature and pressure defined?","The actual temperature and pressure, as defined for §98.233, refer to the 'average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions.' This means that the average temperature and pressure at a given location based on annual averages can be used to determine the actual temperature and pressure. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum, natural gas production, and gathering facilities in both Eastern and Western U.S., along with information on methane and hydrocarbon emission factors for different equipment and services. The data can be utilized for environmental impact assessments and regulatory compliance in the respective regions.","Actual temperature and pressure as defined for §98.233 is the 'average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions.'

It explicitly states that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading associated with onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting facilities must report GHG emissions under Subpart W.,3,0.2159090909,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading are included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W.

23,How do I define a facility under subpart W? Are all industry segments included in one annual GHG report?,"A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties, emitting or capable of emitting any greenhouse gas. This includes electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment, gathering and boosting systems, natural gas distribution pipelines, and carbon dioxide production well facilities. The definition also encompasses seasonal facilities, federally owned facilities, and petrochemical plants. Therefore, all industry segments are not included in one annual GHG report, as different types of facilities are subject to reporting based on the defined criteria. Additionally, various emission factors and population emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing are available for different regions in the U.S. These factors are essential for calculating greenhouse gas emissions and complying with reporting requirements. Furthermore, there are conversion factors provided for converting units such as tons to metric tons, pounds to parts per million (ppm), molecular weights, and time units, which are crucial for accurate emissions calculations and reporting.","A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties, emitting or capable of emitting any greenhouse gas.

Annual CO2 emissions, CH4 emissions, N2O emissions, and biogenic CO2 emissions, all expressed in metric tons. The emissions are from various sources such as venting gas directly to the atmosphere, completions venting gas directly to the atmosphere, and production and transformation processes. Additionally, continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO2 mass emissions.{

}","EPA does not have an exact estimate of what percent of U.S. emissions are covered under petroleum and natural gas systems at this time.  The petroleum and natural gas systems source category (Subpart W) requires reporting from facilities above an emissions threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e.  It is difficult to quantify what net emissions occurr below the threshold.  In addition, facilities below the threshold may not be directly comparable to facilities over the emission threshold due to differences in the types of emission sources covered.  EPA will continue to analyze the emissions from reports as well as linking the information to the US GHG Inventory to identify what fraction of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are covered by the GHGRP.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information about how the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP can be determined based on specific emissions reported from relevant facilities.

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) had a significant impact on emissions estimation during specific time periods, allowing facilities to estimate emissions when required measurement data could not reasonably be obtained. These methods were utilized for various parameters such as fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock, and well-related measurement data for oil wells with hydraulic fracturing. The use of BAMM required approval from the Administrator and had specific time limitations, with extensions available under certain circumstances. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors for different components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S., which are crucial for emissions estimation and monitoring. The data in the tables can be used in conjunction with BAMM to enhance emissions estimation and monitoring practices for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. However, the specific equations related to environmental regulations and calculations mentioned in the text were not entirely clear, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive explanation without additional context or clarification.","The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) allowed facilities to estimate emissions for specific time periods when required measurement data could not reasonably be obtained according to monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

}","In order to provide Petroleum and Natural Gas System facilities with time to adjust to the requirements of the GHGRP, EPA made available the optional use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for unique or unusual circumstances.  Where a facility used BAMM, it was required to follow emission calculations specified by the EPA, but was allowed to use alternative methods for determining inputs to calculate emissions.  These inputs are the values used by reporters to calculate equation outputs or results.  Examples of BAMM include monitoring methods used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W), supplier data, engineering calculations, and other company records.  It is not immediately apparent how the use of BAMM affected emissions, because facilities used BAMM in different ways and for different parameters depending on their unique or unusual circumstances.",4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affected emissions estimation during specific time periods.

Additionally, the answer highlights the importance of the provided tables containing emission factors for different components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. for enhancing emissions estimation and monitoring practices. However, the answer also acknowledges that the specific equations related to environmental regulations and calculations mentioned in the text were not entirely clear, which prevents a perfect score.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affected emissions. It states that BAMM allowed facilities to estimate emissions when required measurement data could not reasonably be obtained, and that these methods were used for various parameters such as fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock, and well-related measurement data for oil wells with hydraulic fracturing. It also mentions that the use of BAMM required approval from the Administrator and had specific time limitations, with extensions available under certain circumstances. The answer also notes that the provided tables contain emission factors for different components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S., which are crucial for emissions estimation and monitoring.

32,How does the petroleum and natural gas systems data reported under the GHGRP compare to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB)?,"{'comparison': 'The GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP (Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program) are subject to detailed monitoring and reporting requirements as specified by the regulations. This includes specific reporting requirements for emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions, as well as the annual quantity of petroleum products and natural gas liquids. Additionally, there are specific thresholds for reporting emissions based on the amount of CO2 equivalent emitted per year.', 'details': {'comparison_with_CARBS': 'The specific emission factors and component counts provided in the tables for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, major crude oil production equipment, and underground natural gas storage offer insights into the quantitative aspects of emissions. These factors and counts are crucial for assessing and comparing the data reported under the GHGRP with that reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The detailed emission factors and component counts can aid in evaluating the environmental impact and regulatory compliance of petroleum and natural gas systems in different regions of the United States.'}}","The GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas sources must be quality assured as per the specified regulations. Offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities have specific reporting requirements for emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. The facilities are also required to report the annual quantity of petroleum products and natural gas liquids. Additionally, there are specific thresholds for reporting emissions based on the amount of CO2 equivalent emitted per year. Therefore, the data reported under the GHGRP for petroleum and natural gas systems is subject to detailed monitoring and reporting requirements as specified by the regulations.{

33,"What are the notification requirements when an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin?","When an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin, the facility must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the equipment using the Component Count Method. The facility should also adhere to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements as set forth in the regulations. Therefore, notification requirements involve reporting specific emissions as per the guidelines outlined in Subpart W of the regulations. Additionally, the emission factors for various components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, including valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves. This data can be used to calculate and report the emissions accurately. The default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment are also available, which can aid in the notification process. The information also includes the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states, providing clarity on the geographical scope. Furthermore, leaker emission factors and total hydrocarbon emission factors for different equipment and services are provided, offering valuable insights for reporting requirements.","When an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin, the facility must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the equipment using the Component Count Method. The facility should also adhere to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements as set forth in the regulations. Therefore, notification requirements involve reporting specific emissions as per the guidelines outlined in Subpart W of the regulations.{

35,What are the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available?,"{'answer': 'When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations, annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b). This applies to various scenarios such as onshore natural gas processing facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, LNG import and export industry segment, and more. The specific methods for determining the GHG mole fraction vary based on the facility type and the nature of the gas stream. Therefore, it is essential to follow the guidelines outlined in the regulations for each specific scenario. Additionally, the provided tables contain default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, and total hydrocarbon population emission factors for underground natural gas storage. These factors and counts are crucial for understanding and calculating emissions in the absence of a continuous gas composition analyzer.', 'explanation': 'The provided text explains the requirements for determining GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available. It also provides tables containing default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and scenarios, which are essential for emission calculations in the absence of a continuous gas composition analyzer.'}","When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations, annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b).

","Per 40 CFR 98.233(u)(2)(i), if you do not have a continuous gas composition analyzer, then you must use an annual average gas composition based on your most recent available analysis of the sub-basin category or facility, as applicable to the emission source.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available. It also mentions that annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b) and provides additional information about default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and scenarios, which are crucial for emission calculations in the absence of a continuous gas composition analyzer.",3,0.1228668942,,,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally.

36,What are the requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare?,"The requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare include: annual volume of flare gas combusted during normal operations from company records (MMscf/year), volume of flare gas combusted during indexed start-up, shutdown, or malfunction event from engineering calculations (scf), volume of flare gas combusted during measurement period (scf), and the total volume of associated gas sent to sales in standard cubic feet. Additionally, the use of flow measurement devices on the flare, calculation methods for flare stacks, and estimation of carbon content for start-up, shutdown, or malfunction events exceeding 500,000 scf/day are also specified. The emission factor data provides additional insights into the population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production and crude oil production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. The data also includes leaker emission factors for various components and equipment, as well as methane population emission factors for LNG storage, transmission compression, and underground gas storage. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also provided for reference.","The requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare include: annual volume of flare gas combusted during normal operations from company records (MMscf/year), volume of flare gas combusted during indexed start-up, shutdown, or malfunction event from engineering calculations (scf), volume of flare gas combusted during measurement period (scf), and the total volume of associated gas sent to sales in standard cubic feet.

If an annual report for reporting year (RY) 2011, 2012 or 2013 is resubmitted, then the deferred report corresponding to that year should also be updated and resubmitted as part of the Subpart W RY2014 report. This should be done even if no deferred data has changed from the previous submission.  This will ensure that your revised RY2011, RY2012, and/or RY2013 annual reports and Deferred Data Reporting Forms are correctly linked and can be processed by EPA.",,,5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It clearly states that if an annual report is resubmitted for RY2011, 2012, or 2013, it must contain complete information specified in paragraphs (a) through (i) of the section and calculate CO2e using the GWPs in Table A–1 of subpart A of this part (as in effect on January 1, 2015). Therefore, the Subpart W deferred data submission(s) must be updated to include the complete and accurate information for the specified reporting years.

Specifically, facilities that become newly subject to subpart W may use best engineering estimates for any data that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained during the first 6 months of required data collection. Additionally, within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, you shall submit the verification data and information as described in the section. Furthermore, for any values associated with CO2 emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions of CO2 from surface equipment at the facility that are reported in this subpart, missing data estimation procedures should be followed in accordance with those specified in subpart W of this part. Therefore, you can update your deferred data submission using best engineering estimates and following the specified procedures for missing data estimation. In addition, when updating your deferred data submission, you can utilize the default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and the default methane population emission factors for LNG storage facilities as provided in the regulations.","To update your Subpart W deferred data submission(s) after resubmitting an annual report for RY2011, 2012, or 2013, you must follow the procedures outlined in the regulations.

40,"For a 2011 report with the ""Liquefied Natural Gas Storage"" option selected, how does the ""calculation utility"" excel spreadsheet account for ""Population Count and Emission Factors"" when providing the user with a final CO2e number?","The calculation utility for the LNG storage takes into account the annual volume in Mscf of natural gas withdrawn from on-system storage and annual volume in Mscf of vaporized liquefied natural gas (LNG) withdrawn from storage for delivery on the distribution system. It also considers the annual volume in Mscf of natural gas placed into storage or liquefied and stored. The LNG storage calculation also involves the GHG mole fraction in natural gas stored in the LNG storage industry segment, where a default 95 percent methane and 1 percent carbon dioxide fraction can be used or site-specific engineering estimates based on best available data. Therefore, the calculation utility considers these factors when providing the user with a final CO2e number. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts from the provided tables are used to calculate the CO2e number. The emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic devices are considered, along with the component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering equipment. Furthermore, the methane population emission factors for LNG storage, specifically the vapor recovery compressor, are also taken into account in the final CO2e calculation.","The calculation utility for the LNG storage takes into account the annual volume in Mscf of natural gas withdrawn from on-system storage and annual volume in Mscf of vaporized liquefied natural gas (LNG) withdrawn from storage for delivery on the distribution system.

    ""result"": ""The provided input contains a mix of LaTeX equations and non-LaTeX text. The LaTeX equations appear to be related to various conversion factors, emission factors, and activity rates in the context of environmental regulations. However, the equations are fragmented and incomplete, making it difficult to infer their exact meanings or applications. It seems that these equations are intended for calculations related to emissions, such as mass of fluorinated GHG emitted, conversion factors for tons to metric tons, molecular weights, and flow rates of process vent streams. Without complete context and clear labels for the variables, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive explanation of each equation. Further information or clarification on the specific regulations and parameters associated with these equations would be necessary to fully interpret their meanings and applications.""

}","BOEMRE typically publishes a GOADS study after March 31 of the year following the data collection.  Therefore, for Subpart W, offshore reporters subject to BOEMRE must use the latest BOEMRE published emissions data (which may be 2008, as the 2011 GOADS report may not be available).  As a further clarification, the reporters will report under Subpart W using the BOEMRE methodologies published in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 with the latest BOEMRE emissions data.  In subsequent years, reporters in state and non-Gulf of Mexico waters will report using the GOADS methodologies published in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304, which historically have been published along with the GOADS emissions data.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate conclusion based on the provided information, stating that the 2011 BOEMRE data can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility.

49,By when do onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report?,"Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. Onshore facilities must also report emissions from reciprocating compressors, centrifugal compressors with wet seal degassing vents, and gathering and boosting equipment. Offshore production facilities must report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in data collection and emissions estimation study published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 (GOADS) or use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE. Therefore, both onshore and offshore production facilities are required to report specific greenhouse gas emissions as outlined in CFR 98 Subpart W. Additionally, specific emission factors for different components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. The emission factors include population emission factors for various components, major equipment emission factors, and leaker emission factors for different survey methods. These factors are crucial for the accurate reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from onshore and offshore production facilities as per CFR 98 Subpart W.","Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

","Therefore, if the facility is subject to the rule and is under BOEMRE jurisdiction but is a new facility that is not included in the most recently published GOADs report, then you must calculate calendar year 2011 emissions for equipment leaks, vent, and flare emission sources using the GOADS methodologies in the most recently published GOADS report. New facilities, whether or not under GOADS jurisdiction, have to follow 98.233(s)(4), which states, “For either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions.”",,,5,"The provided context clearly states that offshore facilities subject to GOADS must use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 250.304 to calculate and report annual emissions. Since published GOADS data are not available, they should use the GOADS methodologies to calculate the emissions. Therefore, the answer is logically true based on the information contained in the context.",3,0.3981900452,2,The answer attempts to answer the question but conveys a little uncertainty by stating that published GOADS data are not available and that the GOADS methodologies should be used to calculate emissions.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise response to the question. It also includes additional information about default emission factors and component counts for onshore facilities, which may be relevant for offshore facilities subject to GOADS when calculating emissions.",752,
52,Are the emissions factors listed in Table W-1A for both leaking components and non-leaking components? How do you calculate emissions from leaking components if onshore petroleum and natural gas source are not required to monitor components?,"The emission factors for both leaking and non-leaking components are provided in the tables. Table W-1A contains default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering/boosting facilities. It includes population emission factors for various components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. Table W-1E provides default whole gas leaker emission factors for the same facilities, specifying emission factors for different components and gas services based on survey methods. Additionally, Table W-2 presents default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, distinguishing between compressor and non-compressor components. The emission factors are used in conjunction with specific calculation methods involving default carbon share factors, CO2 emission factors, and site-specific adjustments to calculate emissions from both leaking and non-leaking components.","The emission factors for petroleum products and natural gas liquids are determined using specific calculation methods described in the section. The calculation methods involve using default carbon share factors, default CO2 emission factors, direct measurements of density and carbon share, and developing reporter-specific CO2 emission factors using outlined methods. Additionally, the emission factors must be adjusted for different operating scenarios and calculated on a site-specific basis. The specific details for the calculation methods and factors used are provided in the section.{

The context states that 'The average thoroughput of oil as described in § 98.233(j)(1) is an annual average.' The answer correctly identifies this fact and provides additional reasoning to support the conclusion.,4,0.3157894737,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,5,The answer is coherent and provides a clear and accurate response to the question asked.,290,
54,How should the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks be determined to compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1)?,"To determine the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks and compare it with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1), you should calculate the annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to applicable onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks. If the average daily throughput of oil is greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, you should then calculate the annual CH4 and CO2 emissions using the specified Calculation Methods 1, 2, or 3 as per paragraph (j) of the section 98.233. The minimum and maximum concentration of CH4 in flash gas from onshore production and onshore natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks should also be considered. Additionally, the emission factors for various components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, which can be used in the calculation of CH4 and CO2 emissions. The component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment are also available for consideration. Finally, the population emission factors for underground natural gas storage and LNG storage are provided for comprehensive emission calculations.","To determine the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks and compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1), you should calculate the annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to applicable onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks.

}","Although the definitions of “facility” are different for subparts A/C and subpart W, it is possible that the physical location of a given facility for purposes of reporting subpart A/C in 2011 (RY2010) is the same as the physical location of the facility for purposes of reporting subparts A/W in 2012 (RY2011).  If this is the case, you should use the same e-GGRT ID and insert the relevant information for 2011 to cover all source categories required at your facilities, including the addition of subpart W data for the first time in RY2011.  It depends.",,,5,"The answer directly and logically follows from the information provided in the context. It states that for an onshore natural gas production facility subject to subpart C for RY2010 and subpart W for RY2011, the basin emissions should be reported under the same facility registration used for the RY2010 report.

These equations specify the calculation of flowback rates for well completions and well workovers in each sub-basin and well type combination. The flowback rates are based on measurements of gas flowback rates and pressures downstream of a separator, indicating that they are calculated under actual conditions. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment, which further support the understanding that the results of Equations W-11A and W-11B are in actual conditions.","Equations W-11A and W-11B specify the calculation of flowback rates for well completions and well workovers in each sub-basin and well type combination.

61,Are geologic provinces 160 and 160A one basin or separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"Geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. The distinction between these two geologic provinces indicates that they are treated as distinct areas in terms of reporting and facility definition. Additionally, the emission factors and equipment counts provided for the Eastern and Western U.S. further support the delineation of these provinces as separate basins. The population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and component counts are specified separately for the Eastern and Western U.S., reinforcing the distinct treatment of these regions in the context of onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.","Geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to accurately track and monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, and treating of petroleum and/or natural gas. This reporting ensures that emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from various source types such as equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flaring are properly documented and accounted for, thereby contributing to the overall understanding and regulation of GHG emissions in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry. Additionally, specific emission factors and equipment counts for different regions, such as the Eastern and Western U.S., were identified to provide a more detailed understanding of the emissions and equipment involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. These factors and counts contribute to the comprehensive tracking and regulation of GHG emissions, aiding in the development of effective environmental policies and practices within the industry.","The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to accurately track and monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, and treating of petroleum and/or natural gas.

}","When the GHGRP requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production were proposed, EPA’s goal was to provide a facility definition that all producers could directly apply, and that would be both practical and cost-effective.  EPA sought public comment on a range of possible options for defining the facility that would report with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, ranging from defining the facility at the individual well pad, to defining the facility at the field-level, to defining the facility at the basin-level.  Taking into account public comment, EPA finalized the definition of facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production using a basin-level approach because the operational boundaries and basin demarcations are clearly defined and are widely known, and the approach covered most emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin.

64,What are the optional delayed reporting requirements for wildcat wells and delineation wells?,"For wildcat wells and delineation wells, the reporting of gas to oil ratio and volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production can be delayed if they are the only wells used for measurement. However, if the reporting is delayed, the gas to oil ratio and volume of oil produced must be reported by the specified date. Therefore, optional delayed reporting requirements are available for wildcat wells and delineation wells. Additionally, there is detailed data on emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, as well as population emission factors for various gas services and storage facilities. This data can be used to understand and manage emissions from these facilities.","For wildcat wells and delineation wells, the reporting of gas to oil ratio and volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production can be delayed if they are the only wells used for measurement.

65,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my oil well operations to decide whether I need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing?,"The gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations can be determined by calculating the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. This can be calculated using the average GOR values specified in Equation W–18 of the subpart. If the GOR from each well is not available, the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category can be used. Additionally, for well venting during completions or workovers with hydraulic fracturing that have a GOR of 300 scf/STB or greater, emissions need to be reported. Therefore, based on the available information, it is possible to determine the GOR for oil well operations and decide whether emissions from completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing need to be reported. The provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to gas and oil production. These tables can be used to assess and calculate the emissions associated with oil and gas operations, which is essential for determining whether reporting of emissions from completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing is required.","The gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations can be determined by calculating the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure.

Additionally, it mentions that emissions need to be reported for well venting during completions or workovers with hydraulic fracturing that have a GOR of 300 scf/STB or greater.

66,How should a gathering and boosting facility that previously reporting under Subpart C report in RY2016?,"In RY2016, a gathering and boosting facility should report all relevant emissions from the gathering and boosting equipment, including CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion sources integral to the movement of natural gas, as specified in § 98.233(z). This encompasses the collection, compression, dehydration, and transportation of petroleum and/or natural gas to processing or distribution facilities. The facility should consider the population emission factors for various components, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic pumps, and others, as well as emission factors based on the survey method used. Additionally, the facility should take into account the default average component counts for major equipment and the whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting as provided in the tables for the Eastern and Western U.S. regions.","A gathering and boosting facility, as defined in this context, includes all gathering pipelines, compressors, process equipment, and associated activities under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin. This encompasses the collection, compression, dehydration, and transportation of petroleum and/or natural gas to processing or distribution facilities.

It specifically pertains to plants that perform this separation process. The NGL fractionators are required to follow specific procedures including reporting quantities of constituents of mixtures or blends separately, using measurement for NGLs at custody transfer meters, and determining quantity based on meter records provided by pipelines or other entities.

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific sources as specified in the regulations. The emission factors for different components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. have been provided, including valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps. Additionally, the average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment have been outlined for both regions. The leaker emission factors and total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression have also been detailed, along with the population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression. This comprehensive data can be used to monitor and report vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing in accordance with regulatory requirements.","Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific sources as specified in the regulations.{

}","If the natural gas processing plant and the underground storage operations are part of the same facility, as defined in 98.6 you would report as one facility and submit one annual GHG report for these operations.  EPA has provided guidance on how reporters should report for co-located industry segments and dual purpose equipment, please see the comment response number EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14, Response To Comments (1606 - 1608) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, addressing all important aspects and providing additional information on how the emission factor data can be utilized for reporting purposes.",5,"The answer follows logically from the information contained in the context. It clearly states that if a natural gas processing plant is co-located with an underground storage facility and they share compression, they can report as one combined facility for reporting purposes.",5,0.3292682927,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any indication of uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally.

75,"If fuel gas lines are not owned or operated by a gas processing facility, but are on the gas processing facility property, do the fuel gas lines need to be monitored for equipment leaks?","Based on the provided information, if the fuel gas lines are on the gas processing facility property and contain only vapors from specific activities that are combusted in a thermal oxidizer or thermal incinerator, and if the annual average flow rate of fuel gas does not exceed 345 standard cubic feet per minute at 60 °F and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute, then the fuel gas lines do not need to be monitored for equipment leaks. This conclusion is supported by the emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as the leaker emission factors for various components and survey methods. The data indicates that the emission factors and component counts fall within the specified thresholds, thus not requiring monitoring for equipment leaks.","Based on the provided information, if the fuel gas lines are on the gas processing facility property and contain only vapors from specific activities that are combusted in a thermal oxidizer or thermal incinerator, and if the annual average flow rate of fuel gas does not exceed 345 standard cubic feet per minute at 60 °F and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute, then the fuel gas lines do not need to be monitored for equipment leaks.{

It states that if the fuel gas lines are on the gas processing facility property and contain only vapors from specific activities that are combusted in a thermal oxidizer or thermal incinerator, and if the annual average flow rate of fuel gas does not exceed 345 standard cubic feet per minute at 60 °F and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute, then the fuel gas lines do not need to be monitored for equipment leaks.

78,How should I calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids?,"Based on the provided information, the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids should be set at an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. Any processing plant meeting or exceeding this throughput threshold should be considered for reporting. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities are available for further analysis and assessment of emissions.","To calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, you should consider the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater as the threshold. According to the provided information, processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the industry segment for reporting purposes. Therefore, any onshore natural gas processing plant meeting or exceeding this throughput threshold should be considered for reporting.{

}","The Rule states in §98.230(a) that the onshore natural gas processing industry includes all plants that fractionate, as well as all plants that do not fractionate that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.  Only those non-fractionating facilities with an annual average throughput of less than 25 MMscf per day would not be subject to reporting under subpart W even if the reporting threshold is triggered in Subpart C.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, including the specific threshold for reporting onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, and additional information on available emission factors and component counts for further analysis and assessment of emissions.",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by stating that the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids should be set at an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. It also correctly states that any processing plant meeting or exceeding this throughput threshold should be considered for reporting. The answer also acknowledges that further analysis and assessment of emissions can be done using the available emission factors and component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities.,4,0.4285714286,1,The answer provides a clear and specific response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear and concise explanation of how to calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids. It also mentions the availability of emission factors and component counts for further analysis and assessment of emissions.,517,
79,What is the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often must a facility re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold?,"The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities is that processing plants that fractionate gas liquids, and processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the onshore natural gas processing segment. Facilities must re-evaluate whether they fall below this threshold on an annual basis to determine if they are still categorized under the onshore natural gas processing segment. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for major equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These tables offer valuable data for assessing emissions and equipment characteristics in the context of natural gas processing and transmission.","The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities is that processing plants that fractionate gas liquids, and processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the onshore natural gas processing segment.

}","However, please note that if, in year 2, your throughput capacity is less than 25 MMscf per day, you are not required to calculate and report GHG emissions from gas processing in year 2.  You would still be required to report other covered emissions at your facility.  This is because gas processing would not be an applicable segment for year 2.  Nevertheless, your facility would still be required to report in year 2, even if facility-wide emissions are less than 25,000mt CO2e, and would continue to report until you meet the criteria in 98.2(i) for ceasing to report.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.  This throughput is re-evaluated annually.  Once you are subject to the rule (e.g., your facility contains a source category listed in Table A-4), your facility must continue complying with all the requirements of this part, even if the facility does not meet the applicability requirements in a future year (i.e., 25,000 mtCO2e for petroleum and natural gas systems). The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities and how often facilities must re-evaluate whether they fall below this threshold.

Therefore, it deserves a rating of five stars.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of which requirement takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility. The answer is directly supported by the information provided in the context, which states that the requirements of the applicable subpart take precedence over subpart A, and provides a specific example of a conflict between the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold and the 25 MMscf per day throughput. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",2,0.3779527559,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It directly answers the question and provides additional relevant information about the provided tables containing emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as methane emission factors for LNG storage, import, export, and natural gas distribution.

The answer also includes additional information about using CEMS for estimating emissions from mine ventilation systems and the availability of emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services.",1,0.315,,,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, how intermittent emissions from the storage tank are treated, and whether an alternative method can be used to quantify the emissions. The answer also provides additional information about the emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services that can be used for estimating emissions in various scenarios.",1578,
86,"For transmission tank venting sent to the flare, the reporter is referred to the emissions source for flare stack emissions, but guidance is only provided for upstream production and gas processing in this section.","When reporting emissions from transmission storage tank vent stacks that vent to a flare, specific information must be provided, and the calculation method of flare stacks in paragraph (n) of the regulations should be used to determine storage tank emissions sent to a flare. To calculate these emissions, the default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, along with the average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, should be considered. Additionally, the default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, the total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, and the total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression are relevant for accurate reporting.","Based on the information provided, it is indicated that if scrubber dump valve leakage occurred for a transmission storage tank vent stack and the vent stack vented to a flare during the calendar year, then specific information must be reported. The calculation method of flare stacks in paragraph (n) of this section should be used to determine storage tank emissions sent to a flare. Therefore, the regulations require reporting of emissions from transmission storage tank vent stacks if they vent to a flare, and a specific calculation method is provided for this purpose.{

89,How does a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability?,"{'final_answer': 'Based on the provided information, the natural gas compressor station and emergency generator would determine subpart applicability based on the specific emissions and equipment components present at the facility, as outlined in the regulations. The station includes compressors that move natural gas from production fields, processing plants, or other transmission compressors through transmission pipelines, and it also includes equipment for liquids separation and storage of water and hydrocarbon liquids. The equipment components at the facility may be subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a of this chapter. Additionally, for facilities in onshore natural gas transmission compression, the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment must be reported. Therefore, the determination of subpart applicability would depend on the specific emissions and equipment components present at the natural gas compressor station and emergency generator facility, as outlined in the relevant regulations.', 'tables_info': 'The provided tables contain default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, total hydrocarbon population emission factors for underground natural gas storage, and methane leaker emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. These tables provide specific emission factors and component counts for different types of equipment and services, which can be used for emissions calculations and regulatory compliance.'}","To determine subpart applicability for a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator, the relevant information can be found in the sections (4) Onshore natural gas transmission compression and (9) Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting.

So long as a the emergency generators meet the definition of “emergency equipment” as stated in 98.6, emissions from the emergency generators are exempt and should not be calculated.  If the facility is subject to 40 CFR part 98, you should report combustion emissions pursuant to the applicable requirements of subpart C (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).  Pursuant to 40 CFR 98.2, if a facility’s calculated total annual emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons of CO2e and the facility does not contain a source category listed in Table A-3 of 40 CFR part 98, subpart A, then the facility does not have to report under 40 CFR part 98 as a direct emitter.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determines subpart applicability based on the specific emissions and equipment components present at the facility, as outlined in the regulations. The answer also mentions the equipment components at the facility that may be subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a of this chapter, and the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment that must be reported for facilities in onshore natural gas transmission compression. Therefore, the answer is highly relevant to the given question and context, and provides all the important aspects required for a complete and accurate answer.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determines subpart applicability based on the specific emissions and equipment components present at the facility, as outlined in the regulations.

92,How do we report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir?,"Facilities must report SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level, including emissions from equipment installed at off-site electric power transmission or distribution locations. Emissions from natural gas distribution, petroleum and natural gas gathering, boosting, production, and transmission pipeline industry segments must be reported if emitting 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only for facilities meeting specific conditions. Therefore, emissions from separate facilities injecting or withdrawing gas from the same underground storage reservoir must be reported based on the specific emission thresholds and industry segment requirements. To calculate emissions, the mass or volume of fuel combusted per year, high heat value of the fuel, and fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor are essential. Additionally, the annual CO2 mass emissions from natural gas combustion and annual natural gas usage need to be considered. Furthermore, specific population emission factors and average component counts for major equipment in different regions provide valuable data for emission calculations. The designations of Eastern and Western U.S. help in determining the applicable factors for different locations. Finally, the default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for natural gas processing, natural gas transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage provide crucial information for reporting emissions accurately.","Facilities must report SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level, including emissions from equipment installed at off-site electric power transmission or distribution locations.

bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W. The definition of underground natural gas storage specifically refers to subsurface storage, including depleted gas or oil reservoirs and salt dome caverns. It also includes storage that involves processes such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, excluding transmission pipelines. Since the high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations do not meet these criteria, they should not be considered as underground natural gas storage facilities under Subpart W.{

The reporting requirements for underground natural gas storage facilities, as specified in the regulations, necessitate separate emission reports for the respective operators. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts for different equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression further support the need for separate emission reports to accurately capture and address the emissions from each operator's activities.","Yes, the respective operators of the underground storage facility and the associated storage wellheads jointly owned and operated by a second company should submit separate emission reports. The regulations clearly specify reporting requirements for underground natural gas storage facilities, including the equipment and activities involved, which necessitates separate emission reports for the respective operators.{

The regulations clearly specify reporting requirements for underground natural gas storage facilities, including the equipment and activities involved, which necessitates separate emission reports for the respective operators. The emission factors and component counts for different equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression further support the need for separate emission reports to accurately capture and address the emissions from each operator's activities.",2,0.2919708029,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise explanation based on the regulations and the provided data, supporting the need for separate emission reports for the respective operators of the underground storage facility and the associated storage wellheads, jointly owned and operated by a second company.",742,
96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"Natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components because the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are designed to cover the entire range of sources within the facilities, including compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. This is achieved through total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads, and total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service, which encompass all relevant sources within the storage facilities. Therefore, there is no need for differentiation as the emission factors are comprehensive and inclusive of all relevant components.","The reason natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment is because the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are based on the sources specified for the segment, including total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads, and total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service. These emission factors cover the entire range of sources within the underground natural gas storage facilities, including compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. Therefore, the differentiation between compressor and non-compressor components is not necessary as the emission factors are designed to encompass all relevant sources within the storage facilities.{

}","EPA does not have sufficient data to support the differentiation of compressor and non-compressor components for underground storage.  Should peer-reviewed data become available, at a time deemed appropriate by EPA,  EPA would consider evaluating information on different emission factors for compressor and non compressor components for the underground natural gas storage industry segment under subpart W.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components. It correctly states that the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are designed to cover the entire range of sources within the facilities, including compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. The answer also correctly identifies the use of total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads, and total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service, which encompass all relevant sources within the storage facilities. The answer concludes that there is no need for differentiation as the emission factors are comprehensive and inclusive of all relevant components.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are designed to cover the entire range of sources within the facilities, including compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. This is achieved through total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads, and total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service, which encompass all relevant sources within the storage facilities. Therefore, there is no need for differentiation as the emission factors are comprehensive and inclusive of all relevant components.

97,Does Subpart W require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility or does reporting start only when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage?,"Subpart W does require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility. The regulations specify the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4B to this subpart for underground natural gas storage facilities. Additionally, the tables provide detailed information on emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, and transmission compression. The emission factors cover a range of components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and more. This comprehensive data can be used to accurately assess and report emissions throughout the entire process of natural gas production and storage, including the salt dome mining phase.","Yes, Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility. The regulations specify the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4B to this subpart for underground natural gas storage facilities.{

Additionally, it should adhere to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements as specified in the regulations. The population emission factors for various components in both Eastern and Western U.S., average component counts for major equipment, and leaker emission factors for different survey methods should be considered for accurate reporting.","The facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recovery and storage should report the relevant information specified in the paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (xvii), (z), and (5) of this section.

A pressure relief valve is a special type of valve and falls in the category of ""other,"" so this emission source is included in the leak detection survey and required to be reported.  Regarding your first question: sections 98.232(g) and 98.232(h) do no include venting from LNG storage tanks as an emission source; therefore venting emissions from LNG storage tank are not required for LNG storage or for LNG import and export equipment.  However, if the LNG storge tank is blown down to atmosphere, then section 98.232(h) does require reporting.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, stating that emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals must be calculated. The answer also provides additional details on how to calculate these emissions, including the use of specific software programs and the emission factors provided in the tables. The answer fully addresses the main aspects of the question and is therefore highly relevant.",5,"The answer directly and accurately states that emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals must be calculated using operating conditions and specific software programs. The answer also correctly mentions that emission factors for various components and equipment in different locations are provided in the tables, which can be used to calculate the emissions based on the specific operating conditions at the facilities or terminals.",2,0.2887700535,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-written and provides a clear and concise response to the question.

105,"At LNG Storage sites, how should pumps that are internal and submerged be treated?","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated by reporting the quantities of LNG added into storage and withdrawn from storage in the calendar year, in thousand standard cubic feet, as specified in the applicable paragraphs of the regulations. Additionally, for reporting GHG emissions from equipment leaks from valves, pump seals, connectors, and other equipment leak sources in LNG service, the appropriate default methane leaker emission factors listed in Table W–5A to this subpart should be used. These factors include emission factors for components such as valves, pump seals, connectors, and other equipment leak sources, with specific values for different survey methods as specified in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7).","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated by reporting the quantities of LNG added into storage and withdrawn from storage in the calendar year, in thousand standard cubic feet, as specified in the applicable paragraphs of the regulations.

109,Are natural gas distribution facilities required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulator(s) under §98.232(i )?,"Yes, natural gas distribution facilities are required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulator(s) under §98.232(i). The content specifies that natural gas distribution facilities must report the information specified in paragraphs (r)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, and that facilities with emission sources listed in § 98.232(i)(1) must also report the information specified in paragraphs (q)(3)(i) through (viii) and, if applicable, (q)(3)(ix) of this section. Additionally, the default methane emission factors for natural gas distribution provide specific population emission factors for various components, including connectors, block valves, control valves, pressure relief valves, orifice meters, regulators, and open-ended lines. These factors vary based on different conditions such as inlet pressure and material type. Furthermore, the tables provide population emission factors for different components and materials in both the Eastern and Western U.S., giving insight into the emission factors for gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service, and gathering pipelines by material type. The average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering and boosting equipment are also provided, detailing the number of valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves for various equipment categories in both the Eastern and Western U.S.","Yes, natural gas distribution facilities are required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulator(s) under §98.232(i).

110,Please explain how many leak detection surveys must be conducted a calendar year?  Must a facility indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year?,"At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year. If multiple complete leak detection surveys are conducted in a calendar year, the results from each complete survey must be used when calculating emissions using Equation W–30. Facilities must indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year, and for natural gas distribution facilities, the number of years in the leak survey cycle must also be reported. Therefore, the facility must plan and report the number of surveys to be conducted in advance for the year. The emission factor data and component counts provided in the tables can be used to calculate the expected emissions from various components and equipment. The information can aid in determining the frequency and scope of leak detection surveys, ensuring compliance with regulations and efficient emissions management.","At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year.

The answer also mentions the reporting requirements for natural gas distribution facilities and the use of emission factor data and component counts to aid in determining survey frequency and scope. Overall, the answer addresses all important aspects of the question and provides a comprehensive and relevant response.",5,"The answer clearly states that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year and facilities must indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year. The answer also mentions that if multiple complete surveys are conducted, the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",2,0.3093333333,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the required number of leak detection surveys that must be conducted in a calendar year, and the facility's obligation to report the number of surveys to be conducted in advance for the year. The answer also mentions the use of emission factor data and component counts to aid in determining the frequency and scope of leak detection surveys, which shows a good understanding of the topic.",873,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"Based on the provided information, the EPA allows natural gas distribution facilities to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period. If a facility chooses the multiple year option, the number of transmission-distribution transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle. Therefore, if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components, they could potentially request a sunset provision from the EPA so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required, provided they can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment. The decision to provide a sunset provision would be subject to EPA approval based on the specific circumstances and compliance with the criteria outlined in the regulations. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as the designation of Eastern and Western U.S., are provided for further context in evaluating the environmental impact of the facilities. The equations and unresolved equations related to emissions factors and calculations are also available for more detailed analysis and understanding of the emission estimation process.","Based on the provided information, the EPA allows natural gas distribution facilities to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period.

We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question. The answer talks about a monitoring plan and emission factors for gas production and gathering equipment, which is not related to the question about the monitoring plan's consistency with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'",1,"Based on the information provided in the context, it is not possible to determine if the monitoring plan aligns with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' Therefore, the answer cannot be rated as 5 or any integer score between 1 and 5. The only possible rating is 1, which indicates that it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.2288828338,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. The answer acknowledges that the monitoring plan does not specify the exact percentage of stations to be monitored in each year, but provides additional information on emission factors and test parameters that suggest further clarification is needed to fully assess consistency with the rule language.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the monitoring plan described in the text does not specify the exact percentage of stations to be monitored in each of the years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. However, it also acknowledges that further information or clarification is needed to fully assess the consistency of the monitoring plan with the rule language. The answer is partially coherent as it presents relevant information but lacks a clear and concise conclusion.",739,

When using the acoustic leak detection device, the instrument manufacturer's calculation methods must be used to quantify the through-valve leak, and a leak is detected if a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated. Additionally, acoustic stethoscope type devices can be used to identify non-leakers, and subsequent measurement is required to calculate the rate if through-valve leakage is identified. Infrared laser beam illuminated instruments can be used for equipment leak detection, and any emissions detected are considered a leak unless screened with Method 21 monitoring, where 10,000 ppm or greater is designated a leak.{

118,Do acid gas removal units which are used only to sweeten a liquid stream meet the definition of acid gas removal units?,"Based on the provided information, acid gas removal units (AGRs) are defined as process units that separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas using liquid or solid absorbents or membrane separators. The definition specifies that acid gas removal units include processes such as amine, membrane, molecular sieve, or other absorbents and adsorbents. The emissions from AGR vents are calculated for CO2 only, not CH4, vented directly to the atmosphere or emitted through a flare, engine, or sulfur recovery plant. Therefore, acid gas removal units used only to sweeten a liquid stream, and vent CO2 directly to the atmosphere, are considered as acid gas removal units based on the definition provided. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to natural gas and crude oil production, transmission, and storage. However, these tables do not directly address the definition of acid gas removal units or their classification. Therefore, the conclusion about the classification of acid gas removal units is solely based on the definition provided in the text analysis.","Based on the provided information, acid gas removal units (AGRs) are defined as process units that separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas using liquid or solid absorbents or membrane separators.

119,"If all of the emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside of the facility, does the facility still need to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then ""reduce"" the emission to zero?","If all of the CO2 emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero. This calculation involves considering various factors such as population emission factors, leaker emission factors, component counts for major equipment, and designation of regions. It also involves the assessment of emission factors for different components and equipment types involved in natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and distribution. The provided tables contain detailed default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and regions, which are essential for accurate emission calculations and reduction strategies.","Yes, if all of the CO2 emissions from the AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero.{

}","With regards to acid gas injection wells and subparts PP and UU, please see the response to EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-0582-31 in the Response to Comments (pages 1474 - 1476) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf.  EPA requires reporters to calculate emissions from AGR units and then adjust them downwards by the amount transferred outside of the facility.  Therefore, if 100% of the CO2 recovered from an AGR unit is transferred outside of the facility, then CO2 emissions from the AGR unit must be calculated prior to determining the amount being transferred outside the facility.  Note that §98.236(c)(3) requires separate reporting of both the AGR emissions and emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility, even if the values are the same.",,,5,"The answer directly addresses the question and provides a clear and accurate response based on the information provided in the context. It cites the relevant section (98.233(d)(11)) and explains that even if all CO2 emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, the facility still needs to calculate emissions and reduce them to zero. It also provides additional information about the factors involved in emission calculations and reduction strategies, which demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic.",1,0.28,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent and provides a comprehensive explanation of the calculation process for emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11). It also mentions the importance of considering various factors such as population emission factors, leaker emission factors, component counts for major equipment, and designation of regions. The answer also refers to the provided tables containing detailed default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and regions, which are essential for accurate emission calculations and reduction strategies.",799,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"Facilities performing on-site acid gas injection cannot estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. Additionally, the provided tables contain detailed information on default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and designation of Eastern and Western U.S. The tables also include default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, and total hydrocarbon population emission factors for underground natural gas storage.","Facilities performing on-site acid gas injection cannot estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.{

}","The units of measure for emissions calculated in Equation W-3 are in cubic feet per year. However, §98.233(d)(10) requires that the volumetric emissions of equation W-3 be converted into mass emissions using §98.233(v)’s methods.  You must report emissions in metric tons of CO2e to meet the reporting requirements in §98.236(c)(3)(v).  If reporters use the methodology set forth in §98.233(d)(2), then a vent flow meter must be used to determine the total annual volume of vent gas flowing out of the AGR unit.",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate response to both parts of the question. It correctly identifies Equation W-3 as the method for calculating CO2 emissions and also mentions that Equation W-4A or W-4B can be used if a flow meter is available. The answer is relevant and addresses all important aspects of the question based on the context.,5,"The answer clearly states that Equation W-3 specifies the use of a vent meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions and that Equation W-4A or W-4B can be used if a flow meter is available to calculate emissions for CO2 based on the inlet or outlet gas flow rate of the acid gas removal unit. Therefore, a flow meter can be used to calculate annual emission CO2. This logically follows from the information contained in the context.",1,0.0714285714,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise response to the question, including relevant information about Equation W-3 and the use of a flow meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions.",4602,
123,For blowdown vent stacks does the 98.233.i reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume refer to a gas volume or a physical container volume?,"The reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks pertains to the unique physical volume of the equipment. This means it refers to the physical container volume and not the gas volume. This is supported by the data which includes emission factors for various components and equipment types, but does not directly relate to gas volume measurements. Instead, it provides information on emission factors for different components and equipment in different locations, indicating a focus on physical equipment rather than gas volume.","The reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks pertains to the unique physical volume of the equipment.

It clearly states that the reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks pertains to the unique physical volume of the equipment, which means it refers to the physical container volume and not the gas volume. The answer also provides supporting evidence from the data which includes emission factors for various components and equipment types, but does not directly relate to gas volume measurements. Instead, it provides information on emission factors for different components and equipment in different locations, indicating a focus on physical equipment rather than gas volume.",3,0.223880597,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-written and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks, and supports it with relevant data. The answer is coherent and easy to understand.",591,
124,"May average blowdown volumes be used for industry segments (processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports) where reporting of this emission source is required?","Yes, average blowdown volumes may be used for industry segments where reporting of this emission source is required. The method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks allows the use of a flow meter to measure blowdown vent stack emissions for unique physical volumes greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. The annual CH4 and CO2 volumetric and mass emissions can be calculated using the flow meter according to the specified methods. Therefore, the use of average blowdown volumes is permissible for reporting in the industry segments where this emission source is required. Additionally, specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and crude oil production are provided, which can be utilized for accurate reporting and compliance with emission regulations.","Yes, average blowdown volumes may be used for industry segments where reporting of this emission source is required.

These methods are allowed in specific circumstances, such as when certain parameters cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of the relevant subpart. However, the use of BAMM is time-limited, and owners or operators are required to discontinue using these methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements by specific deadlines. Requests for extension of the use of BAMM may be submitted to the Administrator under certain conditions. Additionally, the data from the tables provides emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting, as well as crude oil production, natural gas processing, transmission, storage, liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, LNG import and export equipment, and natural gas distribution. These factors and counts are essential for calculating and monitoring emissions in compliance with EPA regulations.","The EPA allows the use of best available monitoring methods for well-related measurement data in specific circumstances, such as when certain parameters cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of the relevant subpart.

The calculation methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd involve different parameters such as dehydrator feed natural gas flow rate, dehydrator absorbent circulation rate, dehydrator outlet natural gas water content, and desiccant dehydrator emissions. This indicates that the emission calculation for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd is distinct from the requirements specified for dehydrators with higher throughputs. Therefore, there is a contradiction between the emission methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd in the preamble and the requirements in the rule. Additionally, the provided table data includes emission factors for various components and equipment in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, as well as for underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and natural gas distribution.

}","However, for the 2011 reporting year onwards, you must include flare stack emissions in the applicability determination, as flares are included under subpart W.Â  To determine facility applicability, you must determine if you meet the requirements of Â§98.2(a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3).Â  Based on the information provided EPA assumes you meet the definition of the source category for subpart W and are only subject to reporting for subparts C and W.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate confirmation that flare emissions, including CO2, CH4, and N2O, are included in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a). The answer also explains that flare stack emissions consist of CO2, CH4, and N2O resulting from the combustion of hydrocarbon gas in flares, and provides additional details on the calculation of annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from flaring gas. The answer further supports its conclusion with information from the table analysis on emission factors for various components and equipment types related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as leaker emission factors and population emission factors for natural gas transmission compression. The answer acknowledges that the formula analysis did not provide any relevant equations or explanations, but still provides a comprehensive and accurate response to the question.",5,"The provided text confirms that flare emissions including CO2, CH4, and N2O are included in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a).

}","Under §98.232(e), emissions from flare stacks are not required to be reported as a separate emission source for onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities.  However, this does not exclude the reporting of flared emissions from the other emission sources listed in §98.232(e) if they are routed to a flare.  The flare source type in §98.233(n) covers only emissions that are not reported in association with any of the other source types in §98.233; see §98.233(n)(10).  For example, if transmission storage tank emissions are going to a flare, then the rule requires the adjustment of transmission storage tank emissions sent to flare per §98.233(k)(4).  The flared transmission storage tank emissions, however, have to be reported as transmission storage tank emissions under §98.236(c)(9).",5,"The answer is perfectly relevant to the question and provides additional valuable information about default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to natural gas production, transmission, and distribution.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, citing the relevant sections of the rule and providing additional information about default emission factors and component counts for natural gas equipment and services.
