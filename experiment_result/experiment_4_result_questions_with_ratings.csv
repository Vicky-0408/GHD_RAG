Facilities covered by this rule might also be required to report emissions under other subparts of the GHG Reporting Program, if applicable.  The GHG Reporting Program requires reporting of GHG emissions: CO2, CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated GHGs: hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases.  These gases are often expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e).",,,5,"The context clearly states that CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions at offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are covered under the rule.

It outlines the requirements for reporting emissions from various equipment and activities, such as well-pads, gathering pipelines, compressors, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares. It also specifies the calculation methods and emission factors to be used for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from different components and services.

4,Do the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements?,"The given input provides information about the definition of 'facility' in the rule and its impact on other EPA reporting requirements. It specifies the criteria for reporting greenhouse gas emissions from various types of facilities, such as electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting facilities, natural gas distribution, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper manufacturing, and semiconductor manufacturing. The rule outlines specific thresholds and conditions for reporting emissions from different types of equipment and processes within these facilities, as well as the requirements for reporting under different subparts of the rule based on the type and amount of emissions. It also addresses the need for designated representatives, alternative reporting methods, and the submission of annual GHG reports electronically. Additionally, the input includes several tables providing default emission factors and component counts for different types of equipment and facilities, such as onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting equipment, crude oil production equipment, natural gas processing, natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. These tables contain detailed data on emission factors for various components and equipment, as well as population emission factors for different services and components. The information in the input does not contain specific numerical values or formulas, but it provides detailed data that can be used to calculate emissions and assess their impact on EPA reporting requirements.","The definition of 'facility' in the rule affects other EPA reporting requirements by specifying the criteria for reporting greenhouse gas emissions from various types of facilities, such as electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting facilities, natural gas distribution, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper manufacturing, and semiconductor manufacturing.

You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control.

See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",,,5,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the document's contents, including the methods for identifying, calculating, and reporting greenhouse gas emissions from various industrial processes.

For 2012 only, the GHG report must be submitted to EPA by September 28, 2012. This reporting deadline applies to all subparts being reported by the facility. If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",,,5,"The answer provides a direct and accurate response to the question by stating that reporting for subpart W begins when the reporter uses Calculation Method 1 and retains records of laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used to estimate the CO2 emissions of petroleum products, natural gas liquids, biomass, and feedstocks reported under this subpart. The additional information provided about emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting equipment is also relevant and supports the answer's accuracy.",1,0.1802575107,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent.

The sentences fit together naturally and flow smoothly, making the answer easy to understand.",538,,

It also specifies the method (EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7) for determining the number of sources of equipment type with screening values greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv. Additionally, the document provides various tables containing default emission factors and component counts for different equipment types and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions. These tables can be used to calculate emissions based on the given equipment counts and emission factors.

How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The provided input contains a lot of technical information related to emissions factors, component counts, and survey methods for various equipment and facilities in onshore petroleum and natural gas production. However, it does not specifically mention the operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons or its correlation with the barrels of crude oil produced. The information provided includes default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, population emission factors, and methane emission factors for different equipment and facilities. While this information is relevant to understanding emissions in the industry, it does not directly address the specific correlation between the operating factor for associated gas venting and the barrels of crude oil produced.","The document provides detailed information about onshore petroleum and natural gas production, including equipment, facilities, and reporting requirements. It mentions the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources, such as equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

14,Where can I find the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"The document provides information on the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. It mentions that the screening tool can be found by analyzing a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or each county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting for oil composition and Reid vapor pressure using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization. Additionally, it includes details about the determination of the gas to oil ratio (GOR) of the hydrocarbon production from oil well(s) tested and the production rate from gas well(s) tested. Furthermore, it provides information on the best available monitoring methods for measurement data for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, as well as the calculation methods for annual CH4 and CO2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and gathering and boosting storage tanks. The document also contains several tables with default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering and boosting facilities in the Eastern and Western U.S. These tables can be used to calculate emissions and assess environmental impact.","The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production can be found by analyzing a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or each county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting for oil composition and Reid vapor pressure using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization.

16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emission from the data. The different methods specified in the regulations for determining volumetric emissions from reciprocating rod packing equipped with an open-ended vent line versus those not equipped with an open-ended vent line may lead to the difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting. The regulations specify different methods for calculating emissions based on the operating mode of the compressor, and the calculation methods involve Equation W–29D for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and Equation W–29C for manifolded groups of compressor sources. Additionally, the document provides tables with population emission factors for different components and regions, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment. These tables can be used in the calculation methods to determine the vented emissions. The emission factors and survey methods specified in the tables can be used in the equations to calculate the vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting.","The difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting may be due to the different methods specified in the regulations for determining volumetric emissions from reciprocating rod packing equipped with an open-ended vent line versus those not equipped with an open-ended vent line.

Additionally, the document contains tables with default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission. These tables provide information on emission factors for different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components. The tables also specify different survey methods and their associated emission factors. However, the document does not explicitly provide the calculation methodologies for the emissions related to subpart W. Therefore, it is important to consult the specific regulations and guidelines under subpart W of 40 CFR part 98 to determine the exact monitoring plan requirements and calculation methodologies for the emissions in question.","The document contains information about reporting emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary combustion units under subpart C of 40 CFR part 98.

The document also outlines the calculation methodologies for determining CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, and provides guidance on reporting requirements for different types of fuel combustion units. The equations and explanations provided in the document describe the calculation methodologies for determining CO2 emissions from fuel combustion units. It includes equations for calculating fuel mass or volume, default high heat value of the fuel, fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor, conversion factors, annual natural gas usage, and annual CO2 mass emissions from natural gas combustion. Additionally, the document contains tables with default emission factors for different components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting equipment, crude oil production equipment, natural gas processing, natural gas transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage. These tables provide emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components, along with average component counts for major equipment in different regions of the U.S. The information in the document does not directly provide a specific threshold determination for emissions from external combustion sources with rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu/hr, but it does offer the necessary calculation methodologies and emission factors for reporting and determining CO2 emissions from fuel combustion units.","The document specifies that external fuel combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu/hr do not need to report combustion emissions or include these emissions for threshold determination in § 98.231(a).

23,How do I define a facility under subpart W? Are all industry segments included in one annual GHG report?,"A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. The definition also includes specific criteria for different industry segments such as electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas distribution, carbon dioxide production wells, cement production, ethanol plants, and more. The annual GHG report includes information from each facility, and there are specific requirements for reporting at the facility level. The document also mentions various conditions and criteria for facilities in different industry segments, such as equipment attachment, seasonal operations, foundation attachment, and specific reporting requirements for different types of facilities. Additionally, the document provides various equations and tables related to emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for different industry segments, which are used for calculating greenhouse gas emissions.","A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas.

Furthermore, it includes tables with default emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, natural gas processing plants, transmission compression, underground storage, LNG storage, and natural gas distribution. These tables provide emission factors for various components and equipment, along with different survey methods, such as continuous monitoring or Method 21, and population emission factors for different gas services and material types.","The document contains information about annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from venting gas directly to the atmosphere, as well as emissions from various industrial processes and fuel combustion. It also mentions the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) for quantifying CO2 mass emissions and the calculation methods for different types of emissions. Additionally, it specifies emission thresholds for reporting from different industry segments related to petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting. The document also discusses the estimation of emissions from cover gases and carrier gases, as well as the reporting requirements for fluorinated GHG emissions. Overall, it provides detailed guidelines and requirements for reporting emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems facilities.{

Additionally, the document provides various equations and explanations related to emission factors, conversion factors, and measurement methods for different components and equipment in the petroleum and natural gas industry.

29,Did all petroleum and natural gas system facilities subject to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program report to EPA?,"The document provides detailed definitions and requirements for reporting greenhouse gas emissions from various segments of the petroleum and natural gas industry. It outlines the criteria for defining a facility within each segment, specifies the emission sources that must be reported, and mentions the threshold for reporting emissions. However, it does not explicitly state whether all petroleum and natural gas system facilities subject to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program reported to EPA. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is inconclusive whether all facilities reported to EPA. The document also includes tables with emission factors for different components and equipment in the petroleum and natural gas industry, as well as population emission factors for various segments such as onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting, natural gas processing, transmission compression, LNG storage, and offshore production. These tables provide specific emission factors for different components and equipment, which can be used in the calculation and reporting of emissions as per the methods outlined in the document.","The document provides detailed definitions and requirements for reporting greenhouse gas emissions from various segments of the petroleum and natural gas industry, including onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting, natural gas processing, transmission compression, LNG storage, and offshore production.

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The document provides detailed information on the implementation and limitations of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for emissions measurement. It includes tables with default emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting equipment, natural gas processing plants, transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage. The tables also contain average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and crude oil production. Additionally, there is a designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference. The text mentions the use of specific survey methods and provides emission factors for different scenarios, such as using Method 21 for surveying. However, the text does not explicitly state how the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affected emissions. It provides the necessary data and equations for calculating emissions but does not directly address the impact of BAMM on emissions.","The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) is described in the text, including the parameters measured, time periods during which the methods were used, and the requirements for requesting extensions. The text also mentions the calculation methodologies and equations to be used in conjunction with BAMM. It outlines the conditions under which BAMM can be used, the approval criteria, and the discontinuation of using BAMM. Additionally, it specifies the reporting provisions and the specific source types for which BAMM can be used. Overall, the text provides detailed information on the implementation and limitations of BAMM for emissions measurement.{

However, it does not explicitly address the notification requirements when an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin. Therefore, based on the given input, there is no specific information available regarding the notification requirements for this scenario.","The notification requirements when an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, the text provides detailed information about the definition of Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production, reporting requirements, emission calculation methods, and equipment types associated with the production and gathering of petroleum and natural gas. It also outlines the criteria for considering multiple wells and equipment in a basin as one facility. The text emphasizes the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources and provides specific calculation methods for different equipment types. It also mentions the requirement to report emissions from specific industry segments only if they emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Additionally, it specifies the reporting requirements for different equipment types and geographic locations. However, specific notification requirements for selling wells and associated equipment in a basin are not explicitly addressed.{

38,"Per FAQ 815, I need to update my Subpart W deferred data submission(s) after I have resubmitted an annual report for RY2011, 2012 or 2013. How do I do it?","To update the Subpart W deferred data submission(s) after resubmitting an annual report for RY2011, 2012, or 2013, the facility must follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting as specified in each relevant subpart of this part. The facility must also submit the verification data and information within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, and the request must be submitted within 45 days following promulgation of Subpart W or within the first 30 days of each subsequent reporting year. Additionally, the facility must use best engineering estimates for any data related to newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of Subpart W for the first 6 months of required data collection. The document also provides equations and explanations for emission calculations, including fuel combustion, high heat value, CO2 emission factors, conversion factors, and annual CO2 mass emissions from natural gas combustion. Furthermore, it includes default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and crude oil production equipment. The tables also contain information on the designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground storage. The data in the tables provides detailed information on emission factors for different components and survey methods, which can be used to update the Subpart W deferred data submission(s) after resubmitting an annual report for RY2011, 2012, or 2013.","To update the Subpart W deferred data submission(s) after resubmitting an annual report for RY2011, 2012, or 2013, the facility must follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting as specified in each relevant subpart of this part.

41,How do I determine applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources?,"The document provides detailed requirements for reporting emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary combustion units under subpart C of the regulations. It also specifies applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, including onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities. The methods for calculating and reporting emissions under subpart C are outlined, and it is mentioned that facilities must report GHG emissions under Subpart W if they meet the applicability requirements of specific sections. The document also includes specific instructions for calculating and reporting emissions from different types of stationary fuel combustion units, such as boilers, process heaters, and other miscellaneous combustion sources. Additionally, the document provides equations and explanations for calculating fuel, high heat value (HHV), CO2 emission factor (EF), and annual natural gas usage. Furthermore, it includes several tables with default emission factors and average component counts for different equipment and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions, which can be used to calculate emissions for reporting purposes.","The document provides detailed requirements for reporting emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary combustion units under subpart C of the regulations.

43,"Are sites in south Louisiana located within the State boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous (not in Federal waters but subject to the ebb and flow of the tide) considered to be seaward of the terrestrial border and thus offshore?","The text defines offshore as seaward of the terrestrial borders of the United States, including waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, as well as adjacent bays, lakes, or other normally standing waters. The provided tables contain population emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. The tables also include default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. Additionally, there is a table that designates the states in the Eastern and Western U.S. The information from the tables does not directly address the specific question about sites in south Louisiana located within the State boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous, and whether they are considered to be seaward of the terrestrial border and thus offshore. However, the definition of offshore provided in the text aligns with the question's description of sites in south Louisiana located within the State boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous, indicating that they would be considered offshore.","The text defines offshore as seaward of the terrestrial borders of the United States, including waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, as well as adjacent bays, lakes, or other normally standing waters.{

The emission thresholds for reporting are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but the emission values provided (20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources) exceed typical reporting thresholds, indicating that reporting would be required.

}","Yes. The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",4,"The answer provides relevant information about the reporting requirements for GHG emissions from offshore facilities based on the provided emission values and the document's guidelines.

It provides equations for calculating emissions from various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The document also includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering and boosting equipment, as well as default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting. Additionally, it provides default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage.

48,"If an offshore oil and gas production platform or facility is farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, does that facility have to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C?","The document mentioned that offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions to the EPA. The emissions are to be reported from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. However, the specific distance from the state waters is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The document also includes various equations and tables related to emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for different types of equipment and services. These equations and tables provide detailed information on how to calculate and report emissions data for different scenarios and components.

51,"How are new offshore facilities that are subject to GOADS supposed to report in 2012? Since published GOADS data are not available, should they be using the GOADS methodologies to calculate the emissions?","The document mentions that offshore production facilities subject to GOADS are required to use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE to report annual emissions. It also states that new offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods to calculate and report emissions. Although it does not explicitly mention the use of GOADS methodologies for calculating emissions in 2012, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that new offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE to calculate and report annual emissions in 2012.

Facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction should report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE. For offshore facilities not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle, they must use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods to calculate and report emissions. The document also mentions specific reporting requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. It does not explicitly state whether new offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the GOADS methodologies to calculate emissions in 2012, as the focus is on reporting requirements. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that new offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE to calculate and report annual emissions in 2012.{

It correctly mentions that they should use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE, and infers that GOADS methodologies should not be used since published GOADS data are not available. However, it could have been more concise and clear in its explanation.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context. The document mentions that new offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods to calculate and report emissions. Therefore, since published GOADS data are not available, new offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods to calculate the emissions in 2012.",3,0.4603174603,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation of the requirements for reporting annual emissions for offshore facilities subject to GOADS.

52,Are the emissions factors listed in Table W-1A for both leaking components and non-leaking components? How do you calculate emissions from leaking components if onshore petroleum and natural gas source are not required to monitor components?,"The document provides information on the calculation methods for determining emission factors for petroleum products and natural gas liquids. It outlines the use of default emission factors, unit-specific emission factors, and site-specific emission factors. It also mentions the calculation of emissions from different operating conditions and the development of adjusted process-vent-specific emission factors. Additionally, the document contains specific tables with data on default emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. The tables include population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and total hydrocarbon emission factors for different equipment and components. The provided information does not explicitly mention the calculation of emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources. However, it does provide emission factors for leaking components, which can be used in conjunction with the count of components to estimate emissions. The emission can be calculated using the formula: E = COUNT * EF, where E is the total emissions, COUNT is the number of units, and EF is the emission factor. Therefore, to calculate emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources, the count of components and the corresponding emission factors from the provided tables can be utilized.","The document provides information on the calculation methods for determining emission factors for petroleum products and natural gas liquids.

However, the provided information does not contain specific details or formulas for calculating the daily oil throughput based on the mentioned calculation methods. It does include tables with default population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and gas leaker emission factors. These tables provide emission factors for various components and equipment, but they do not directly address the determination of daily oil throughput. Therefore, further information or specific calculation methods for determining the daily oil throughput based on the mentioned calculation methods would be needed to provide a comprehensive answer.","The daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks should be determined based on the Calculation Methods 1, 2, and 3 as specified in paragraph (j) of the section 98.233.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and regulate emissions from these facilities. The reporting by basin allows for a more precise understanding of the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production, as emissions can vary significantly based on geographic location and the unique characteristics of each basin. This approach enables the EPA to implement targeted regulations and mitigation strategies to address the specific environmental challenges associated with different basins, ultimately contributing to more effective environmental protection and management. Additionally, the provided tables contain population emission factors for different components and material types in both Eastern and Western U.S., which further emphasizes the need for basin-specific reporting to accurately track and regulate emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.","The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and regulate emissions from these facilities.

}","When the GHGRP requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production were proposed, EPA’s goal was to provide a facility definition that all producers could directly apply, and that would be both practical and cost-effective.  EPA sought public comment on a range of possible options for defining the facility that would report with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, ranging from defining the facility at the individual well pad, to defining the facility at the field-level, to defining the facility at the basin-level.  Taking into account public comment, EPA finalized the definition of facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production using a basin-level approach because the operational boundaries and basin demarcations are clearly defined and are widely known, and the approach covered most emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. It states that this reporting allows for a more precise understanding of the environmental impact of production, which can vary significantly based on geographic location and unique characteristics of each basin. This approach enables the EPA to implement targeted regulations and mitigation strategies to address specific environmental challenges associated with different basins, ultimately contributing to more effective environmental protection and management. The answer also mentions the provided tables containing population emission factors for different components and material types in both Eastern and Western U.S., which further emphasizes the need for basin-specific reporting to accurately track and regulate emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",4,0.3629032258,,,5,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. The sentences are well-structured and flow naturally, with each sentence contributing to the overall coherence of the answer. The answer also includes additional information from the provided tables, which further supports the need for basin-specific reporting. Therefore, the answer has perfect coherency and deserves a rating of 5 stars.",991,,

65,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my oil well operations to decide whether I need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing?,"The document provides detailed information on determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations and the requirement to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing if the GOR is 300 scf/STB or greater. It also discusses the use of default compositions in software programs if specific compositions are not available. The document emphasizes the importance of accurately determining GOR and reporting associated emissions. However, the provided text does not contain specific calculation methodologies or measurement methods for determining GOR. It does include tables with default emission factors and component counts for various equipment used in oil and gas production, which could be used in conjunction with specific GOR calculations to determine emissions for reporting purposes.","The text provides detailed information on determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, including the calculation methodology, measurement methods, and scenarios where GOR cannot be determined.

It also outlines the procedures that NGL fractionators should follow, including the use of measurement for NGLs at custody transfer meters, reporting quantities of constituents of mixtures or blends separately, and determination of quantity using meter records or estimates based on contract quantities. Additionally, it specifies the calculation methods and reporting requirements for NGL fractionators, such as using Equation NN–7 for fractionated NGLs received from other fractionators and reporting emissions in decimal fraction. The document also mentions the use of alternative methods for sampling and analysis, as well as the reporting of emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. Overall, the content provides a comprehensive understanding of the definition and procedures related to fractionate and fractionation in the context of NGL fractionators.{

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O. The emissions are calculated based on the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas and facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems. The document also specifies the calculation methods for volumetric GHG emissions from reciprocating compressor venting and wet seal oil degassing vents at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. It mentions the option to use default whole gas leaker factors for components in gas service and the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service. Additionally, it provides the threshold for reporting emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment and the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment. The document also includes several tables providing emission factors and component counts for different regions and equipment types, which can be used in the calculation of vent emissions.","Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O.

The document mentions the requirement to calculate the annual average flow rate of fuel gas and the mention of equipment leaks from valves, pump seals, connectors, and other equipment leak sources in LNG service. Additionally, it provides a method for calculating the annual average flow rate using company records, assuming total flow is evenly distributed over 525,600 minutes per year. The document also includes tables with default whole gas leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon emission factors, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors, default methane population emission factors, and default methane leaker emission factors for various equipment and services. These tables provide emission factors for different components and services, which can be used to assess the need for monitoring fuel gas lines for equipment leaks on the gas processing facility property.",1,0.1595744681,1,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question, without any indication of uncertainty or lack of knowledge.",5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent.

78,How should I calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids?,"The document provides information on the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids and have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. Additionally, it includes calculation methods for emissions from various sources in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and onshore natural gas processing facilities. The document also contains tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. These tables can be used to calculate emissions from different components at these facilities. For example, the 'Default Total Hydrocarbon Emission Factors for Onshore Natural Gas Processing' table provides emission factors for different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and meters. These factors can be used in conjunction with the average component counts to estimate emissions. The 'Default Methane Population Emission Factors for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Storage' table provides emission factors specifically for LNG storage compressors in gas service. These tables and information can be utilized to calculate emissions and determine compliance with reporting thresholds for onshore natural gas processing plants.","The reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater is mentioned in the text. The document also provides information on the calculation methods for emissions from various sources in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and onshore natural gas processing facilities.{

The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3), which is the requirement for onshore natural gas processing plants that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.

Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that the requirements of Subpart W and any other applicable subparts take precedence over the specific thresholds mentioned in the question.","The document mentions that if a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. This means that for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility, the requirements of Subpart W itself and any other applicable subparts would take precedence over the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) or the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3)).{
    ""result"": ""The provided input contains a mix of LaTeX equations and their explanations. However, the explanations are not directly related to the equations, making it difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis of the LaTeX formulas. It seems that the explanations are fragmented and do not correspond to the equations in a clear manner. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a structured analysis of the LaTeX formulas based on the given input.""

It is explicitly stated that if a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. Therefore, for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility, the requirements of Subpart W itself and any other applicable subparts would take precedence over the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold or the 25 MMscf per day throughput. The answer accurately reflects this information.",1,0.384341637,1,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question, without any uncertainty or lack of knowledge.",5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It directly addresses the question and provides a clear explanation based on the information provided in the input.

81,May engineering calculations be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product?,"The document provides guidance on calculating emissions from flare gas, including the use of continuous gas composition analyzers, engineering calculations for gas composition, and methods for determining flare gas higher heating value. It also outlines calculation methodologies for various emissions, such as CO2 and N2O from flare stacks, and provides equations for estimating emissions of specific gases. The document also discusses the use of apportioning factors for gas consumption and emissions, as well as the calculation of emissions from various industrial processes. Overall, it emphasizes the importance of accurate measurement and calculation of gas emissions for environmental reporting. Additionally, the document includes several tables providing default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage. These tables can be used for engineering calculations related to flare gas composition and emissions.","The document provides guidance on calculating emissions from flare gas, including the use of continuous gas composition analyzers, engineering calculations for gas composition, and methods for determining flare gas higher heating value.

83,"Under subpart W, are we required to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane?","The document mentioned several calculation methods and tables related to the emission factors for different components and equipment in the natural gas industry. However, there is no specific mention of calculating potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane under subpart W. The provided tables include default emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps, as well as average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment. While these tables provide valuable information for calculating emissions, they do not directly address the specific scenario mentioned in the question.","Based on the provided text, it is evident that the document contains detailed instructions and equations for calculating various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different sources and processes. However, there is no specific mention of calculating potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane under subpart W. The text primarily focuses on the calculation methods for different types of emissions, such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, from various industrial processes and equipment. It also provides guidance on reporting requirements and default emission factors for different industry segments. Therefore, the specific information related to the question is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.{

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The document mentions two methods for monitoring tank emissions: 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1). Method 98.233(k) involves using continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and calculating emissions based on the concentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor. Method 98.234(a)(1) also involves using CEMS. The intermittent emission from the storage tank can be treated by monitoring the changes in container weights and inventories or by monitoring the changes in individual container weights. An alternative method to quantify the emissions may be used if it meets the applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements. The document also provides population emission factors for different components and equipment in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering sectors, as well as leaker emission factors for different survey methods. It also includes default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression, as well as for underground natural gas storage. The document does not provide specific equations or calculations for deriving emissions, but it does offer emission factors and methods for monitoring and quantifying emissions.","The methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions involve using continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and calculating emissions based on the concentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor.

For example, the 'Default Whole Gas Leaker Emission Factors' table provides emission factors for different components and survey methods, which can be used in the calculation method mentioned in the text. Additionally, the 'Default Total Hydrocarbon Leaker Emission Factors for Onshore Natural Gas Transmission Compression' table provides leaker emission factors for different components and survey methods, which can also be used in the calculation.

89,How does a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability?,"The given text provides detailed information on how a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determines subpart applicability based on the type of equipment and the emissions from the sources specified in the regulations. The station must report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from various sources and use specific default emission factors for different components and equipment. The text also includes tables with default emission factors for different equipment and components, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering and boosting equipment. Additionally, it outlines specific calculation methods for determining the component count for emissions estimation. Overall, the text provides a comprehensive explanation of how the station determines subpart applicability and calculates emissions based on the regulations.","A natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability based on the type of equipment and the emissions from the sources specified in the regulations. The station must report the indication per facility, not per component type, and may elect to comply with specific sections according to the regulations. The station must also report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment, and use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service. Additionally, the station must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific source types, and calculate emissions from reciprocating compressor venting using a specific equation. The station must also use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service, and calculate combustion-related emissions from stationary or portable equipment. Furthermore, the station must use specific default emission factors for LNG storage compressors in gas service, and whole gas population emission factors for gas wells and gathering and boosting facilities. The station must also use specific calculation methods for determining the component count for emissions estimation.{

See response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-19, Response To Comments (1610 - 1611) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf for further details.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question. It does not provide any information about whether CO2 pipelines are subject to the Onshore natural gas transmission compression segment under 40 CFR 98 subpart W.,1,"The provided text does not explicitly address the regulation of CO2 pipelines under 40 CFR 98 subpart W. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether CO2 pipelines are subject to the Onshore natural gas transmission compression segment under 40 CFR 98 subpart W without further information.",1,0.1456953642,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the document does not explicitly address the regulation of CO2 pipelines under 40 CFR 98 subpart W, it provides information about the reporting and calculation of CO2 emissions from different sources in the natural gas industry.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the provided document does not explicitly address the regulation of CO2 pipelines under 40 CFR 98 subpart W. However, it provides information on the calculation methods and emission factors for various components and equipment related to natural gas transmission and production, which may indirectly relate to CO2 pipelines. The answer lacks coherence in connecting the provided information to the question, but it partially addresses the question and provides some relevant information.",932,,
91,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"The document provides detailed information about vented emissions of CH4 and CO2 containing natural gas, including intentional or designed releases from various sources such as offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, natural gas pneumatic devices, blowdown vent stack emissions, and associated gas venting or flaring. It also outlines reporting requirements for emissions from different industry segments and calculation methods for annual natural gas emissions. The text does not explicitly mention unintentional natural gas releases, so it is unclear whether accidental releases are subject to reporting based on the provided information. The document also includes several tables with default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and survey methods, which can be used to calculate emissions from various sources. However, there is no specific mention of unintentional natural gas releases or accidental releases in the provided information.","The document provides detailed information about vented emissions of CH4 and CO2 containing natural gas, including intentional or designed releases from various sources such as offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, natural gas pneumatic devices, blowdown vent stack emissions, and associated gas venting or flaring.

Due to the length and complexity of the input, it is not feasible to analyze each equation individually. However, it seems that the equations are related to various environmental and emission factors, such as emission calculations, conversion factors, emission factors for different gases, and stoichiometric ratios. The equations also involve parameters like mass, volume, concentration, and activity rates. The explanations seem to be fragmented and contain typographical errors, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive analysis of each equation."",

96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"The text mentions that underground natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment. This is because the default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service are specified based on the survey methods outlined in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). The emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meters, and instruments are provided for both survey methods, but there is no differentiation between compressor and non-compressor components. Therefore, the emission factors for natural gas storage facilities are not specified separately for compressor and non-compressor components.","The text mentions that underground natural gas storage facilities must use appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service, and must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service. However, it does not specify different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.{

97,Does Subpart W require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility or does reporting start only when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage?,"Subpart W requires reporting of emissions from various sources, including underground natural gas storage facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. The reporting includes the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary fuel combustion sources. The document also mentions the use of default emission factors for different components and services. It provides specific methods and equations for calculating emissions from different types of facilities and sources. The reporting requirements are detailed and specific, with provisions for using alternative methods under certain conditions. The document also provides tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. These tables provide specific emission factors for different components and services, which can be used to calculate emissions from the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility. Therefore, reporting of emissions is required during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility, and the provided tables and equations can be used to calculate these emissions.","Subpart W requires reporting of emissions from various sources, including underground natural gas storage facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities.

                            ""Open-Ended Line"":","What constitutes a facility, how to determine the reporting threshold, and reporting of emissions from collocated and dual purpose equipment is as follows: 1) As a first step the reporter must determine the emissions from all equipment listed in 98.232(c) for onshore petroleum and production.  Per section 98.231(a) only sources listed in 98.232(c) need to be considered for threshold determination for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. 98.238 defines “facility” for the purposes of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems.  Per the requirements of 98.3 each “facility” must submit a GHG report for all source categories at that “facility”.  2) Note that while identifying onshore production emissions sources reporters have to determine whether the source is “on the well pad or associated with a well pad”.  The location of production wells within other facilities is inconsequential to this determination.  Sources on a well pad or associated with a well pad across the entire reporting basin have to be taken into consideration.  If your emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production are equal to or greater than 25,000mtCO2e, then onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities report as a separate facility and include all emissions sources listed in 98.232(c).  3) Except for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution, which have unique facility definitions, all other segments subject to subpart W are considered in the threshold determination for a single facility.  You would also include emissions from other source categories at your facility (e.g., stationary combustion).  If there are emissions sources that are dual purpose then the rule requires this piece of equipment to be reported under the majority use industry segment based on guidance provided in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (pp. 1606-1608).  4) For collocated industry segments, which cannot occur in the case of onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution due to the requirements in 98.231(a), EPA has provided guidance on emissions reporting in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14.  Based on the information provided, the facility cannot be reported as onshore production and natural gas processing combined (see point 1 above).  For all the other segments, the report should use guidance in points 2-3 above to determine the segment under which the facility should be categorized.",,,5,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the reporting requirements for emissions from facilities that combine onshore petroleum and natural gas production with natural gas storage and enhanced oil recovery operations. It also mentions the calculation methods for estimating emissions from various sources, such as storage tanks and gas-liquid separators, as well as tables with population emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, and default average component counts for major equipment. The answer also specifies leaker emission factors for different survey methods and components, emphasizing the need for accurate data reporting and quality assurance for greenhouse gas emissions from the industry segments mentioned.

100,Are dehydration units that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility?,"The document provides detailed information about the equipment and processes related to dehydrators used in natural gas facilities. It outlines the criteria for reporting information related to glycol dehydrators, desiccant dehydrators, and their emissions. It also specifies calculation methods for annual mass and volumetric emissions from glycol dehydrators and emissions from desiccant dehydrators. The text defines terms such as underground natural gas storage, dehydrator feed natural gas flow rate, dehydrator vent emissions, and wet natural gas. However, it does not explicitly state whether dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility. The document also includes several tables providing default emission factors for various components and equipment in different scenarios, such as onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, natural gas processing plants, natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment. These tables contain emission factors for components like valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meters, and other relevant equipment. However, the specific inclusion of dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility is not explicitly addressed in the provided information.","The document provides detailed information about the equipment and processes related to dehydrators used in natural gas facilities.

}","LNG facilities will not be surveying the valves, connectors, and other components that are in Gas Service under 98.233(q).  At an LNG facility, a compressor that recovers vapor, but is designed so that it does not have reportable emissions of methane-containing gas, such as a flooded screw compressor, or one with seals purged with pressurized nitrogen, will not be reported, in accordance with the rule and the EPA’s response in Response to Public Comments, EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1026-7 (see pp. 45-46 in http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part1.pdf).  Vapor recovery compressors use a population emission factor, hence there is no leak detection required.  Reporters have to count the number of vapor recovery compressors and use the population emission factor.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, addressing all important aspects of the context and question. It not only confirms that only the equipment listed in Table W-5 is required to be reported if it is found to be leaking, but also provides additional information about emission factors for various components in gas service, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering equipment, and specific emission factors for LNG storage compressors. The answer is highly relevant and informative, and therefore deserves a rating of five stars.",5,The answer directly states that only the equipment listed in Table W-5 (Vapor Recovery Compressor) is required to be reported if it is found to be leaking as defined in the rule for liquefied natural gas facility equipment in gas service.

It also includes information about the annual volume of natural gas withdrawn from storage, the quantity of LNG added into storage, and the quantity of LNG withdrawn from storage. Additionally, it discusses the use of default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components and the appropriate default methane population emission factor for LNG storage compressors. The text also explains the calculation methods for estimating CH4 emissions from storage tanks, including the use of tank-specific methane composition data and the estimation methods provided in AP 42, Section 7.1. Therefore, based on the information provided, an LNG storage vessel is considered 'above ground' if any portion of the vessel is above grade.{

105,"At LNG Storage sites, how should pumps that are internal and submerged be treated?","The document does not specifically address the treatment of internal and submerged pumps at LNG storage sites. However, it provides information on various types of pumps and agitators, including dual mechanical seal pumps and absorbent circulation pumps. Additionally, it includes emission factors for pump seals and natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting. The emission factors for pump seals at LNG storage sites are provided, with different values depending on the survey method used. If surveyed using any of the methods in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6), the emission factor for pump seals is 4.00 scf/hour/component, and if surveyed using Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7), the emission factor for pump seals is 0.73 scf/hour/component. This information can be used to understand the emission factors associated with pumps at LNG storage sites.","The document mentions the definition of various types of pumps and agitators, including dual mechanical seal pumps and absorbent circulation pumps. It also defines pump seals and natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting. However, it does not specifically address the treatment of internal and submerged pumps at LNG storage sites.{

It outlines the procedures for calculating equipment leak emissions and specifies the use of Equation W-30 for this purpose. The document also mentions the use of specific leak detection methods such as infrared laser beam illuminated instrument, acoustic leak detection device, and optical gas imaging instrument for detecting leaks. Additionally, it discusses the use of site-specific leak monitoring methods and the reporting requirements for equipment leak surveys. The methodology for calculating emissions from equipment leaks is clearly outlined in the document. The document also includes tables with default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and leaker emission factors for various components and survey methods. These tables provide the necessary factors and counts required for estimating emissions from sources determined to be leaking, as specified in 40 CFR 98.233(r).

                ""tables","For natural gas distribution, a facility, which is the collection of all distribution pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by an LDC, is required to do at least one facility wide leak detection survey per calendar year and has the option to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys; if the facility selects this option, the additional facility-wide survey(s) must be completed during the same calendar year in order to account for fixing one or more leaks in the annual GHG report.  If the facility chooses to fix one or more leaks and conduct another survey to determine that the component is not leaking, it must conduct a facility wide leak detection survey in order to account for fixing the leak(s) in the annual GHG report.  As leaks are random in nature and while some leaks are fixed others are likely to occur.  Therefore, a comprehensive survey is the only statistically relevant manner by which to establish facility-wide leak emissions rates and account for leaks repaired.  Please see the response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1014-9 (Response to Comments, pp. 1281-1282, http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf) for further details.  It is very important to note that the requirement to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys should a company wish to account for fixing a leak does not preclude in any way a company from repairing a leak.  If a company chooses to conduct only one facility-wide leak detection survey in a calendar year but finds a leak during the survey, the company can and is encouraged to fix the leak.  The leak detected though, as noted above, must be reported as a leaker for the entire calendar year should the company choose not to conduct a second survey.",4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year, and that multiple surveys can be conducted if needed. It also mentions the option for natural gas distribution facilities to conduct equipment leak surveys across a multiple-year cycle, not exceeding a five-year period, to cover all above-grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. The answer covers all the important aspects of the question and is mostly relevant.",5,"The document specifies that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year. It also mentions that multiple surveys can be conducted if needed, and the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions. Additionally, natural gas distribution facilities have the option to conduct equipment leak surveys across a multiple-year cycle, not exceeding a five-year period, to cover all above-grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. The number of surveys to be conducted in a year is not explicitly specified, but it is clear that at least one survey is required, and multiple surveys can be conducted if needed. Facilities do not need to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",3,0.3388888889,1,The answer provides a clear and complete response to the question without any uncertainty or lack of knowledge.,4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the minimum requirement of conducting at least one leak detection survey in a calendar year, and the option for facilities to conduct multiple surveys if needed. It also mentions the option for facilities to conduct equipment leak surveys across a multiple-year cycle. However, it could have been more coherent by organizing the information in a more structured manner.",756,,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"The document outlines the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys at natural gas distribution facilities, including the frequency of surveys, reporting methods, and calculation of equipment leak emissions. It specifies that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year, and if multiple surveys are conducted, the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions. It also provides details on the number of surveyed components, the use of different leak detection methods, and the calculation of emission factors. Additionally, it mentions the need to report the annual mass of CO2 emitted by surface leakage and provides guidelines for identifying potential surface leakage pathways. The document does not explicitly mention the possibility of a sunset provision for annual leak surveys, but it provides detailed requirements and methods for conducting such surveys. The tables provided include population emission factors, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, default methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, and default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage. These tables contain specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services, which are used in the calculation of emissions. The document does not provide specific calculations or formulas for determining the need for a sunset provision for annual leak surveys, but it does offer detailed information on the factors and methods used in the emission calculations.","The document outlines the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys at natural gas distribution facilities, including the frequency of surveys, reporting methods, and calculation of equipment leak emissions.

}","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question. It does not address the monitoring plan that results in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year 5, as requested in the question. Instead, it provides information about the requirements for a GHG Monitoring Plan, including the need to complete it by April 1 of the year data collection begins, retention of records for an applicable State continuous monitoring program, and the inclusion of the maximum monitoring area and active monitoring areas in the plan. It also details the timing for submitting a proposed MRV plan and the requirements for using best available monitoring methods. The provided tables contain population emission factors for different components and equipment in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. regions. There is also a table that designates which states belong to the Eastern and Western U.S. regions.",1,"The answer does not provide a direct response to the question. It only summarizes the information provided in the context and tables, and states that there is no specific mention of the monitoring plan described in the question. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the plan is consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'",1,0.2567567568,4,"The answer does not provide any information related to the question asked and suggests rephrasing the question. Therefore, it conveys uncertainty and makes no attempt to answer the question.",2,"The answer mostly lacks coherence. While it provides information about the GHG Monitoring Plan and related requirements, it does not directly address the question of whether a monitoring plan that results in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year 5, would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' The mention of the provided tables and their contents is also not directly relevant to the question.",1253,,
113,What types of instruments are permissible for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W?,"The document specifies the permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W. These instruments include acoustic leak detection devices, infrared laser beam illuminated instruments, optical gas imaging instruments, and high volume samplers. It also mentions the use of manufacturer's calculation methods for quantifying through-valve leakage when using the acoustic leak detection device. Additionally, it outlines the use of Method 21 for monitoring equipment leaks, with a specified instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater indicating a leak. The document provides detailed guidance on the types of instruments, calculation methods, and monitoring approaches permissible for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W.","The permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include acoustic leak detection devices, infrared laser beam illuminated instruments, optical gas imaging instruments, and high volume samplers.

               ","With regards to acid gas injection wells and subparts PP and UU, please see the response to EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-0582-31 in the Response to Comments (pages 1474 - 1476) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf.  EPA requires reporters to calculate emissions from AGR units and then adjust them downwards by the amount transferred outside of the facility.  Therefore, if 100% of the CO2 recovered from an AGR unit is transferred outside of the facility, then CO2 emissions from the AGR unit must be calculated prior to determining the amount being transferred outside the facility.  Note that §98.236(c)(3) requires separate reporting of both the AGR emissions and emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility, even if the values are the same.",3,"The answer provides information on the calculation of CO2 emissions from the Acid Gas Removal (AGR) unit using various calculation methods and specifies that if CO2 emissions from the AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, they should be adjusted downward by the magnitude of the recovered emissions. However, it does not directly address the specific scenario mentioned in the question regarding the need to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero when all emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility. Therefore, the answer is partially relevant to the question.",1,"The document does not provide a clear answer to the specific scenario mentioned in the question regarding the need to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero when all emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",2,0.3712121212,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the answer does not explicitly state whether the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero in this specific scenario, it provides information on the calculation of CO2 emissions from the Acid Gas Removal (AGR) unit using various calculation methods and includes tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions, which can be used in emission calculations.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on the calculation of CO2 emissions from the AGR unit and the adjustment of emissions when they are recovered and transferred outside the facility. However, it does not directly answer the question of whether the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero in this specific scenario.",1252,,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"The document provides detailed information on the calculation of emissions for CO2 from acid gas removal (AGR) vents, including various calculation methods such as Calculation Method 1, Calculation Method 2, and Calculation Method 3. It also mentions the requirement to report the annual quantity of CO2 that was recovered and transferred outside the facility under subpart PP of this part, as specified in § 98.233(d)(11). The document also discusses the injection of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery, and the calculation of annual CO2 emissions from the acid gas removal unit using any one of the calculation methods specified in § 98.233(d)(10) and (11). The provided equations and explanations cover a wide range of factors and conversion methods related to emissions, including emission factors, concentration, flow rate, molecular weight, mass of emitted gases, and more. Additionally, the document includes tables with default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, and more. These tables provide specific emission factors for different components and equipment used in natural gas production and processing. Overall, the document contains comprehensive information on the calculation and reporting of CO2 emissions from acid gas removal vents and related processes.","The document provides information on the calculation of emissions for CO2 from acid gas removal (AGR) vents, including the methods for calculating emissions, such as Calculation Method 1, Calculation Method 2, and Calculation Method 3.

It correctly identifies the requirement to report the annual quantity of CO2 that was recovered and transferred outside the facility under subpart PP of this part, as specified in § 98.233(d)(11), and confirms that facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in this section. The answer also mentions the different calculation methods specified in § 98.233(d)(10) and (11), and provides additional information on the various factors and conversion methods related to emissions, including emission factors, concentration, flow rate, molecular weight, mass of emitted gases, and more. The answer also correctly identifies the presence of tables with default emission factors for different components and equipment used in natural gas production and processing, which further supports the accuracy of the answer.",1,0.1290322581,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides detailed information on the calculation of emissions for CO2 from acid gas removal vents, including various calculation methods and the requirement to report the annual quantity of CO2 that was recovered and transferred outside the facility under subpart PP of this part, as specified in § 98.233(d)(11).

121,For AGR vents is the use of a meter to measure flow rates required?,"The document provides information on the calculation methods for emissions from AGR vents, including the use of a meter to measure flow rates. It also mentions the use of continuous gas analyzers or quarterly gas samples if a continuous gas analyzer is not available. The document also defines AGR vents as including processes such as amine, membrane, molecular sieve, or other absorbents and adsorbents, and specifies that emissions for CO2 only (not CH4) should be calculated. Therefore, the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required for calculating emissions from AGR vents.","The document provides information on the calculation methods for emissions from AGR vents, including the use of a meter to measure flow rates.

However, §98.233(d)(10) requires that the volumetric emissions of equation W-3 be converted into mass emissions using §98.233(v)’s methods.  You must report emissions in metric tons of CO2e to meet the reporting requirements in §98.236(c)(3)(v).  If reporters use the methodology set forth in §98.233(d)(2), then a vent flow meter must be used to determine the total annual volume of vent gas flowing out of the AGR unit.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning that Equation W-3 is not explicitly mentioned in the document and that the use of a flow meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions is not explicitly mentioned either.

","Pursuant to a May 2013 final rule, Subpart W BAMM requests are due by June 30 of the year prior to the year in which reports are due (the “reporting year”) and for which BAMM is sought.  As June 30, 2013 falls on a weekend, BAMM requests for the 2014 reporting year are due by July 1, 2013.  The totality of the circumstances related to conducting isolation valve measurement on compressors in shutdown depressurized mode if fully explained in a proper Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) request may be considered by EPA to constitute unique or unusual circumstances justifying the use of BAMM.",4,"The answer provides relevant information about the requirements for measuring volumetric emissions from isolation valve leakage at compressors in not-operating-depressurized-mode, including the frequency of measurement and the conditions under which it can be taken.

Additionally, it outlines adjustments for emissions if routed to vapor recovery systems or flares/regenerator fire-box/fire tubes.

It accurately states that GRI-GLYCalc can be used instead of Method 2 in §98.233(e)(2) for onshore petroleum and natural gas facility dehydrator vents at glycol dehydrators with throughputs less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day. It also provides additional information about the parameters to be determined for characterizing emissions from dehydrators and the equations for calculating annual volumetric emissions.,522,,

134,Are flare emissions included in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a)?,"The document provides detailed information on the calculation and reporting of flare emissions and their inclusion in the determination of applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a). It specifies specific methodologies for calculating the emissions from flaring gas and addresses the need to account for excess emissions resulting from destruction device malfunctions. Additionally, it includes tables with default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage. The document also provides equations and explanations for various conversion factors and emission calculation parameters, such as molar volume conversion factor, molecular weight, flow rate, and concentration of fluorinated GHGs during emission tests.","Flare stack emissions include CO2, N2O, and CH4 resulting from the combustion of hydrocarbon gas. The emissions from flares must be included in the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions, and there are specific methodologies outlined in the document for calculating the emissions from flaring gas. The document also specifies the calculation methods for different types of flares and provides guidance on when to use specific equations for calculating CO2 emissions from flares. Additionally, the document addresses the need to account for excess emissions resulting from destruction device malfunctions and provides instructions for reporting such excess emissions. Overall, the document provides detailed information on the calculation and reporting of flare emissions and their inclusion in the determination of applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a).{
