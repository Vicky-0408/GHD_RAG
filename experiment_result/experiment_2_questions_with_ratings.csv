1,What GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities are covered under the rule?,"The document mentioned several tables providing default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, and crude oil production equipment. These tables can be used to calculate GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities. The emission factors and component counts are essential for the calculation methodologies required for reporting GHG emissions as per the regulations outlined in the document.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. For these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the subparts listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year.

(3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (c) Content of the annual report. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each annual GHG report shall contain the following information: (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (F) For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) that is not also a fluorinated GHG as specified under (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section. If a fluorinated heat transfer fluid does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated heat transfer fluid is a member. (G) For each reported fluorinated GHG and fluorinated heat transfer fluid, report the following identifying information: (v) Indicate (yes or no) whether reported emissions include emissions from a cogeneration unit located at the facility. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (i) Total quantity of GHG aggregated for all GHG from all applicable supply categories in Table A–5 of this subpart and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart.

(E) Each fluorinated GHG (including those not listed in Table A–1 of this subpart). (13) An indication of whether the facility includes one or more plant sites that have been assigned a “plant code” (as defined under § 98.6) by either the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration or by the EPA's Clean Air Markets Division. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources.

The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010. Upon request by the Administrator, the records required under this section must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper documents. You must retain the following records, in addition to those records prescribed in each applicable subpart of this part: (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for which GHG emission were calculated. (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type. These data include but are not limited to the following information in this paragraph (g)(2): (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used.

(1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data from each measurement device shall be documented in the written monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You","Subpart W of part 98 requires petroleum and natural gas facilities to report annual methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from equipment leaks and venting, and emissions of CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) from flaring, onshore production stationary and portable combustion emissions, and combustion emissions from stationary equipment involved in natural gas distribution. Facilities covered by this rule might also be required to report emissions under other subparts of the GHG Reporting Program, if applicable.  The GHG Reporting Program requires reporting of GHG emissions: CO2, CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated GHGs: hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases.  These gases are often expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e).",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the tables that can be used to calculate GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities. However, it does not directly state which GHG emissions are covered under the rule.",5,"The answer provides information about the tables that can be used to calculate GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities, which is directly related to the question about what GHG emissions are covered under the rule. The answer is logically true and follows logically from the information contained in the context.",2,0.2934782609,2,The answer attempts to answer the question but conveys a little uncertainty by using words like 'several tables' and 'can be used to calculate'.,4,"The answer provides relevant information about the tables that can be used to calculate GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities. However, the answer could have been more coherent by providing a clearer and more concise explanation.",495,,
2,Who must report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems)?,"The document provides detailed information about the GHG reporting requirements for facilities in the United States or under the Outer Continental Shelf. It outlines the conditions for facilities to report their emissions, including the maximum rated heat input capacity and the annual emissions threshold. It also mentions the use of specific calculation methods for determining GHG emissions from stationary fuel combustion units. However, it does not explicitly mention whether the EPA will provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule. The document also includes several tables providing default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, crude oil production equipment, natural gas processing plants, natural gas transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage. These tables offer detailed emission factors for various equipment components and survey methods, which can be used in the calculation of GHG emissions. However, there is no specific mention of a tool provided by the EPA to assist facilities in assessing their applicability under the rule.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. Absorbent circulation pump means a pump commonly powered by natural gas pressure that circulates the absorbent liquid between the absorbent regenerator and natural gas contactor. Administrator means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the Administrator's authorized representative. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. Crude oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities. (1) Depending upon the characteristics of the crude stream, it may also include any of the following: (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (iv) Petroleum products that are received or produced at a refinery and subsequently injected into a crude supply or reservoir by the same refinery owner or operator. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fossil fuel means natural gas, petroleum, coal, or any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material, for purpose of creating useful heat. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Heavy Gas Oils are petroleum distillates with an approximate boiling range from 651 °F to 1,000 °F. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Miscellaneous products include all refined petroleum products not defined elsewhere. It includes, but is not limited to, naphtha-type jet fuel (Jet B and JP–4), petrolatum lube refining by-products (aromatic extracts and tars), absorption oils, ram-jet fuel, petroleum rocket fuels, synthetic natural gas feedstocks, waste feedstocks, and specialty oils. It excludes organic waste sludges, tank bottoms, spent catalysts, and sulfuric acid. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Unstabilized crude oil means, for the purposes of this part, crude oil that is pumped from the well to a pipeline or pressurized storage vessel for transport to the refinery without intermediate storage in a storage tank at atmospheric pressures. Unstabilized crude oil is characterized by having a true vapor pressure of 5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or greater. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wellhead means the piping, casing, tubing and connected valves protruding above the earth's surface for an oil and/or natural gas well. The wellhead ends where the flow line connects to a wellhead valve. Wellhead equipment includes all equipment, permanent and portable, located on the improved land area (i.e. well pad) surrounding one or multiple wellheads. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” The materials listed in this section are incorporated by reference in the corresponding sections noted.

(ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) May be used in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr for the combustion of natural gas and/or distillate fuel oil. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (D) Units in the Acid Rain Program and other units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter may use the best available information described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each fuel type, whenever fuel-specific heat input values cannot be directly obtained from the electronic data reports under § 75.64 of this chapter. (1) All fuel samples shall be taken at a location in the fuel handling system that provides a sample representative of the fuel combusted. The fuel sampling and analysis may be performed by either the owner or operator or the supplier of the fuel. (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. (4) Annual natural gas usage (therms/year) (Equation C–1a of § 98.33). (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). (a) For each electricity generating unit that is subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program or is otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under this subpart the annual mass emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CH<E T=""52"">4 by following the requirements of this subpart. (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (ii) You must notify the EPA of your use of a previously approved alternative method in your annual report. (2) Annual facility cement production. (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account for the anticipated change in your preliminary estimate. You may account for such a change using a quantifiable metric (e.g., the ratio of the number of tools that are expected to be vented to the stack system in the current year as compared to the previous reporting year, ratio of the expected number of wafer starts in the current reporting year as compared to the previous reporting year), engineering judgment, or other industry standard practice. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (i) A properly measured destruction or removal efficiency value must be determined in accordance with EPA 430–R–10–003 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7), or according to an alternative method approved by the Administrator (or authorized representative) as specified in paragraph (k) of this section. If you are measuring destruction or removal efficiency according to EPA 430–R–10–003 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7), you may follow the alternative procedures specified in Appendix A to this subpart. (p) Inventory and description of all abatement systems through which fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O flow at your facility and for which you are claiming destruction or removal efficiency, including: (q) For all abatement systems through which fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O flow at your facility, for which you are reporting controlled emissions, the following: (3) If you use default destruction or removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), certification that the abatement systems for which emissions are being reported were specifically designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. You must support this certification by providing abatement system supplier documentation stating that the system was designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. (4) For all stack systems for which you calculate fluorinated GHG emissions according to the procedures specified in § 98.93(i)(3), certification that you have included and accounted for all abatement systems and any respective downtime in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(i)(3). (ii) A planned analysis of the effect on overall facility emissions using a representative gas-use profile for a 200 mm, 300 mm, or 450 mm fab (depending on which technology is under consideration). (d) For all abatement systems through which fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O flow at your facility, and for which you are reporting controlled emissions, the following in paragraphs (d)(1) to (9) of this section: (ii) Documentation from the abatement system supplier describing the abatement system's designed purpose and emission control capabilities for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O for which the systems or group of systems is certified to abate, where available. (iii) If you use default destruction or removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), certification that the abatement systems for which emissions are being reported were specifically designed for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as required under § 98.94(f)(3), and certification that the site maintenance plan includes manufacturer's recommendations and specifications for installation, operation, and maintenance for all applicable abatement systems. (9) A site maintenance plan for abatement systems, which must be maintained on-site at the facility as part of the facility's GHG Monitoring Plan as described in § 98.3(g)(5), and be developed and implemented according to paragraphs (d)(9)(i) through (iii) of this section. Redundant abatement systems means a system that is specifically designed, installed and operated for the purpose of destroying fluorinated GHGs and N<E T=""52"">2O gases, or for which the destruction or removal efficiency for a fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O has been properly measured according to the procedures under § 98.94(f)(4), and that is used as a backup to the main fluorinated GHGs and N<E T=""52"">2O abatement system during those times when the main system is not functioning or operating in accordance with design and operating specifications. Stack system means one or more stacks that are connected by a common header or manifold, through which a fluorinated GHG-containing gas stream originating from one or more fab processes is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. For purposes of this subpart, stack systems do not include emergency vents or bypass stacks through which emissions are not usually vented under typical operating conditions. (2)","Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year must report. The rule defines three different types of facilities. You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",1,The answer does not address the question at all and provides incorrect information about Marie Curie's profession.,5,"The answer accurately provides information about the GHG reporting requirements for facilities in the United States or under the Outer Continental Shelf, including the conditions for reporting and specific calculation methods for determining GHG emissions from stationary fuel combustion units.",1,0.2655367232,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.

3,What gases must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities?,"The document outlines the GHG reporting requirements for facilities in the United States and the Outer Continental Shelf. It specifies conditions for reporting, including thresholds for emissions, and procedures for discontinuing reporting if emissions fall below certain levels for consecutive years. It also details requirements for reporting emissions from different types of facilities and processes, such as stationary fuel combustion sources, electricity generating units, and adipic acid production processes. The document also provides guidance on alternative methods for determining emissions and destruction or removal efficiency, as well as requirements for reporting technology assessment reports for semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the document includes several tables providing default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and processes in the petroleum and natural gas industry. These tables offer detailed information on emission factors for different regions and equipment components, as well as population emission factors for underground natural gas storage. The provided input contains a mix of LaTeX equations and text, which are used to define parameters such as fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor (EF), high heat value of the fuel (HHV), conversion factors, annual emissions of specific compounds, and various other environmental metrics. The text provides additional context and explanations for these parameters and their definitions, which are essential for understanding the impact of facility definitions on other EPA reporting requirements.","(a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (1) Facility name or supplier name (as appropriate), and physical street address of the facility or supplier, including the city, State, and zip code. If the facility does not have a physical street address, then the facility must provide the latitude and longitude representing the geographic centroid or center point of facility operations in decimal degree format. This must be provided in a comma-delimited “latitude, longitude” coordinate pair reported in decimal degrees to at least four digits to the right of the decimal point. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (vii) The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–6 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2011 until March 31, 2013. The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–7 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2013 until March 31, 2015 (as part of the annual report for reporting year 2014), except as otherwise specified in Table A–7 of this subpart. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than January 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Reporting year means the calendar year during which the GHG data are required to be collected for purposes of the annual GHG report. For example, reporting year 2014 is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the annual report for reporting year 2014 is submitted to EPA on March 31, 2015.

Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (A) For units in the Acid Rain Program and other units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, obtain (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each type of fuel from the electronic data reports required under § 75.64 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(B) and (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section. (D) Units in the Acid Rain Program and other units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter may use the best available information described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each fuel type, whenever fuel-specific heat input values cannot be directly obtained from the electronic data reports under § 75.64 of this chapter. (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (iii) Are not in the Acid Rain Program, but are required to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and heat input data year-round, in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. (a) The electricity generation source category comprises electricity generating units that are subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program and any other electricity generating units that are required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more electricity generating units and the facility meets the requirements of § 98.2(a)(1). (a) For each electricity generating unit that is subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program or is otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under this subpart the annual mass emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CH<E T=""52"">4 by following the requirements of this subpart. (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, continue to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as required under § 75.13 or section 2.3 of appendix G to 40 CFR part 75, and § 75.64. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions as follows: Follow the applicable quality assurance procedures for CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in appendices B, D, and G to 40 CFR part 75. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains an adipic acid production process and the facility meets the requirements of either § 98.2(a)(1) or (2). (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (i) If you received Administrator approval for an alternative method of determining N<E T=""52"">2O emissions in the previous reporting year and your methodology is unchanged, your alternative method is automatically approved for the next reporting year. (ii) You must notify the EPA of your use of a previously approved alternative method in your annual report. (iii) Otherwise, you must submit the request within 45 days following promulgation of this subpart or within the first 30 days of each subsequent reporting year. (iv) If the Administrator does not approve your requested alternative method within 150 days of the end of the reporting year, you must determine the N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for the current reporting period using the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (3) If you requested Administrator approval for an alternative method of determining N<E T=""52"">2O emissions under § 98.53(a)(2), you must conduct the performance test if your request has not been approved by the Administrator within 150 days of the end of the reporting year in which it was submitted. (d) You must determine the volumetric flow rate during the performance test in conjunction with the applicable EPA methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendices A–1 through A–4. Conduct three emissions test runs of 1 hour each. All QA/QC procedures specified in the reference test methods and any associated performance specifications apply. For each test, the facility must prepare an emissions factor determination report that must include the items in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section: (j) If you conducted a performance test and calculated a site-specific emissions factor according to § 98.53(a)(1), each annual report must also contain the information specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (7) of this section for each adipic acid production unit. (k) If you requested Administrator approval for an alternative method of determining N<E T=""52"">2O emissions under § 98.53(a)(2), each annual report must also contain the information specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) of this section for each adipic acid production facility. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), you must report the following information at the facility level: (a) You must report emissions of fluorinated GHGs (as defined in § 98.6), N<E T=""52"">2O, and fluorinated heat transfer fluids (as defined in § 98.98). The fluorinated GHGs and fluorinated heat transfer fluids that are emitted from electronics manufacturing production processes include, but are not limited to, those listed in Table I–2 to this subpart. You must individually report, as appropriate: (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account for the anticipated change in your preliminary estimate. You may account for such a change using a quantifiable metric (e.g., the ratio of the number of tools that are expected to be vented to the stack system in the current year as compared to the previous reporting year, ratio of the expected number of wafer starts in the current reporting year as compared to the previous reporting year), engineering judgment, or other industry standard practice. (3) Follow the QA/QC procedures in accordance with those in EPA 430–R–10–003 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7), or the applicable QA/QC procedures specified in an alternative method approved by the Administrator (or authorized representative) according to paragraph (k) of this section, when calculating abatement systems destruction or removal efficiencies. If you are measuring destruction or removal efficiency according to EPA 430–R–10–003 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7), and you elect to follow the alternative procedures specified in Appendix A to this subpart according to paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, you must follow any additional QA/QC procedures specified in Appendix A to this subpart.

For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year.

Stationary or portable equipment includes the following equipment, wh","Under this rule, facilities will detect, as applicable, and calculate GHG emissions according to the specified quantification methods. See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",4,"The answer provides information on how to register a subpart W facility in e-GGRT and includes details on tables related to environmental regulations and emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting equipment, crude oil production equipment, and onshore natural gas processing plants. However, it does not directly answer the question on how greenhouse gas emissions are calculated for subpart W facilities.",5,"The answer provides detailed information on how to calculate greenhouse gas emissions for subpart W facilities, including the requirement to provide the physical street address or latitude and longitude of the facility, and the availability of default emission factors and component counts in tables provided in the input.

However, the answer could be more concise and organized.",1039,,
5,When does reporting for subpart W begin?,"The document mentioned several tables providing default emission factors and component counts for different types of facilities and equipment under subpart W. These tables include emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic device vents, and pneumatic pumps, as well as counts of these components for different equipment categories and regions. However, the specific equation for emission calculation under subpart W was not explicitly mentioned in the given input.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. For these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the subparts listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012.

(i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (F) For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) that is not also a fluorinated GHG as specified under (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section. If a fluorinated heat transfer fluid does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated heat transfer fluid is a member.

(viii) Applicable source categories means stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all of the source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart present at the facility. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (including those not listed in Table A–1 of this subpart). (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (C) Description of the procedures and methods that are used for quality assurance, maintenance, and repair of all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (h) Annual GHG report revisions. This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data from each measurement device shall be documented in the written monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (4) A change in the GWP for one or more compounds includes the addition to Table A–1 of this subpart of either a chemical-specific or a default GWP that applies to a compound to which no chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart previously applied. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. Conventional-Winter refers to finished gasoline formulated for use in motor vehicles, the composition and properties of which do not meet the requirements of the reformulated gasoline regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 80.40 or the summer RVP standards required under 40 CFR 80.27 or as specified by the state. <E T=""04"">Note: This category excludes conventional blendstock for oxygenate blending (CBOB) as well as other blendstock. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Destruction device, for the purposes of subparts II and TT of this part, means a flare, thermal oxidizer, boiler, turbine, internal combustion engine, or any other combustion unit used to destroy or oxidize methane contained in landfill gas or wastewater biogas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. (4) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous into U.S. jurisdiction exclusively for U. S. military purposes. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Reformulated-Winter refers to finished gasoline formulated for use in motor vehicles, the composition and properties of which meet the requirements of the reformulated gasoline regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 80.40 and 40 CFR 80.41, but which do not meet summer RVP standards required under 40 CFR 80.27 or as specified by the state. <E T=""04"">Note: This category includes Oxygenated Fuels Program Reformulated Gasoline (OPRG). Reformulated gasoline excludes Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending (RBOB) as well as other blendstock. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (6) ASTM D910–07a Standard Specification for Aviation Gasolines, IBR approved for § 98.6.

(4) Flares, unless otherwise required by provisions of another subpart of this part to use methodologies in this subpart. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b.

For 2012 only, the GHG report must be submitted to EPA by September 28, 2012. This reporting deadline applies to all subparts being reported by the facility. If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the document's tables providing default emission factors and component counts for different types of facilities and equipment under subpart W. However, it does not directly answer the question of when reporting for subpart W begins.",1,"The passage provides information about reporting requirements for subpart W, but does not explicitly state when reporting for subpart W begins.",1,0.1201716738,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,1,The answer does not address the question asked.,541,,
6,"Do the emissions from external combustion sources with rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu per hour need to be included in the 25,000 metric ton threshold determination?","The document mentioned several relevant tables that provide emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering and boosting equipment. These tables offer valuable information for calculating and reporting GHG emissions from oil and natural gas facilities. Additionally, the document outlines the calculation methods for determining total facility GHG emissions from stationary fuel combustion units and the requirements for reporting emissions from different types of fuel sources. It also addresses the use of default destruction or removal efficiency values in emissions calculations and the certification requirements for abatement systems. Overall, it provides a comprehensive overview of the regulatory framework for reporting GHG emissions from oil and natural gas facilities.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. Absorbent circulation pump means a pump commonly powered by natural gas pressure that circulates the absorbent liquid between the absorbent regenerator and natural gas contactor. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. Crude oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities. (1) Depending upon the characteristics of the crude stream, it may also include any of the following: (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (iv) Petroleum products that are received or produced at a refinery and subsequently injected into a crude supply or reservoir by the same refinery owner or operator. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fossil fuel means natural gas, petroleum, coal, or any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material, for purpose of creating useful heat. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Heavy Gas Oils are petroleum distillates with an approximate boiling range from 651 °F to 1,000 °F. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Miscellaneous products include all refined petroleum products not defined elsewhere. It includes, but is not limited to, naphtha-type jet fuel (Jet B and JP–4), petrolatum lube refining by-products (aromatic extracts and tars), absorption oils, ram-jet fuel, petroleum rocket fuels, synthetic natural gas feedstocks, waste feedstocks, and specialty oils. It excludes organic waste sludges, tank bottoms, spent catalysts, and sulfuric acid. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Unstabilized crude oil means, for the purposes of this part, crude oil that is pumped from the well to a pipeline or pressurized storage vessel for transport to the refinery without intermediate storage in a storage tank at atmospheric pressures. Unstabilized crude oil is characterized by having a true vapor pressure of 5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or greater. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wellhead means the piping, casing, tubing and connected valves protruding above the earth's surface for an oil and/or natural gas well. The wellhead ends where the flow line connects to a wellhead valve. Wellhead equipment includes all equipment, permanent and portable, located on the improved land area (i.e. well pad) surrounding one or multiple wellheads. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (f) The following material is available for purchase from the Gas Processors Association (GPA), 6526 East 60th Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74143, (918) 493–3872, http://www.gasprocessors.com.

(1) Oil and Gas Field Code Master List 2008, DOE/EIA0370(08), January 2009, IBR approved for § 98.238. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) May be used in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr for the combustion of natural gas and/or distillate fuel oil. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (1) All fuel samples shall be taken at a location in the fuel handling system that provides a sample representative of the fuel combusted. The fuel sampling and analysis may be performed by either the owner or operator or the supplier of the fuel. (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. (4) Annual natural gas usage (therms/year) (Equation C–1a of § 98.33). (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (2) Annual facility cement production. (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (p) Inventory and description of all abatement systems through which fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O flow at your facility and for which you are claiming destruction or removal efficiency, including: (q) For all abatement systems through which fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O flow at your facility, for which you are reporting controlled emissions, the following: (3) If you use default destruction or removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), certification that the abatement systems for which emissions are being reported were specifically designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. You must support this certification by providing abatement system supplier documentation stating that the system was designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. (4) For all stack systems for which you calculate fluorinated GHG emissions according to the procedures specified in § 98.93(i)(3), certification that you have included and accounted for all abatement systems and any respective downtime in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(i)(3). (ii) A planned analysis of the effect on overall facility emissions using a representative gas-use profile for a 200 mm, 300 mm, or 450 mm fab (depending on which technology is under consideration). (d) For all abatement systems through which fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O flow at your facility, and for which you are reporting controlled emissions, the following in paragraphs (d)(1) to (9) of this section: (ii) Documentation from the abatement system supplier describing the abatement system's designed purpose and emission control capabilities for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O for which the systems or group of systems is certified to abate, where available. (iii) If you use default destruction or removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), certification that the abatement systems for which emissions are being reported were specifically designed for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as required under § 98.94(f)(3), and certification that the site maintenance plan includes manufacturer's recommendations and specifications for installation, operation, and maintenance for all applicable abatement systems. (9) A site maintenance plan for abatement systems, which must be maintained on-site at the facility as part of the facility's GHG Monitoring Plan as described in § 98.3(g)(5), and be developed and implemented according to paragraphs (d)(9)(i) through (iii) of this section. Redundant abatement systems means a system that is specifically designed, installed and operated for the purpose of destroying fluorinated GHGs and N<E T=""52"">2O gases, or for which the destruction or removal efficiency for a fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O has been properly measured according to the procedures under § 98.94(f)(4), and that is used as a backup to the main fluorinated GHGs and N<E T=""52"">2O abatement system during those times when the main system is not functioning or operating in accordance with design and operating specifications. Stack system means one or more stacks that are connected by a common header or manifold, through which a fluorinated GHG-containing gas stream originating from one or more fab processes is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. For purposes of this subpart, stack systems do not include emergency vents or bypass stacks through which emissions are not usually vented under typical operating conditions. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (2) Excess emissions. Excess emissions of fluorinated GHGs resulting from destruction device malfunctions must be reflected in the reported facility-wide CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions but are not required to be reported separately. (i) All facilities.

The reporting requirements include submitting annual GHG reports and following the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting as specified in each relevant subpart of this part.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only.

(4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year.

Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012.

For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (c) Content of the annual report. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each annual GHG report shall contain the following information: (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows.

This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (3) A substantive error is an error that impacts the quantity of GHG emissions reported or otherwise prevents the reported data from being validated or verified. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date.

If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (iii) Engineering calculations. (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process unit shutdown. Include","Actual temperature and pressure as defined for §98.233 is the “average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions.”  Therefore, the average temperature and pressure at a given location based on annual averages can be used for actual temperature and actual pressure.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question about the calculation of standard temperature and pressure.,1,The answer does not address the question about the calculation of standard temperature and pressure.

It conveys uncertainty by suggesting that the answer may not be in the provided sources, but it does not make any attempt to answer the question.",4,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of the calculation methodologies for estimating greenhouse gas emissions for subpart W facilities and the reporting requirements for annual GHG reports. However, the answer could be more concise and organized for better coherence.",918,,
8,What emissions are reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities?,"The document provides detailed tables (Table W-1A to Table W-3A) that contain default emission factors, average component counts, and other designations related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. These tables are essential for understanding the calculation methodologies and emission reporting requirements for subpart W facilities. However, the specific information about what must be reported by subpart W facilities, as requested in the question, is not explicitly mentioned in the given input.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. For these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the subparts listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iii) Magnesium Production (subpart T). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (ix) Manufacture of Electric Transmission and Distribution (subpart SS). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (xi) Injection of Carbon Dioxide (subpart UU). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (F) For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) that is not also a fluorinated GHG as specified under (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section. If a fluorinated heat transfer fluid does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated heat transfer fluid is a member. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (viii) Applicable source categories means stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all of the source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart present at the facility. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (including those not listed in Table A–1 of this subpart). (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (C) Description of the procedures and methods that are used for quality assurance, maintenance, and repair of all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (h) Annual GHG report revisions. This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data from each measurement device shall be documented in the written monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (4) A change in the GWP for one or more compounds includes the addition to Table A–1 of this subpart of either a chemical-specific or a default GWP that applies to a compound to which no chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart previously applied. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. Conventional-Winter refers to finished gasoline formulated for use in motor vehicles, the composition and properties of which do not meet the requirements of the reformulated gasoline regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 80.40 or the summer RVP standards required under 40 CFR 80.27 or as specified by the state. <E T=""04"">Note: This category excludes conventional blendstock for oxygenate blending (CBOB) as well as other blendstock. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Destruction device, for the purposes of subparts II and TT of this part, means a flare, thermal oxidizer, boiler, turbine, internal combustion engine, or any other combustion unit used to destroy or oxidize methane contained in landfill gas or wastewater biogas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. (4) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous into U.S. jurisdiction exclusively for U. S. military purposes. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Reformulated-Winter refers to finished gasoline formulated for use in motor vehicles, the composition and properties of which meet the requirements of the reformulated gasoline regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 80.40 and 40 CFR 80.41, but which do not meet summer RVP standards required under 40 CFR 80.27 or as specified by the state. <E T=""04"">Note: This category includes Oxygenated Fuels Program Reformulated Gasoline (OPRG). Reformulated gasoline excludes Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending (RBOB) as well as other blendstock. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (6) ASTM D910–07a Standard Specification for Aviation Gasolines, IBR approved for § 98.6.

(c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (i) Equation C–2a of this section applies to any type of fuel listed in Table C–1 of the subpart, except for municipal solid waste (MSW). For MSW combustion, use Equation C–2c of this section.","Facilities in petroleum and natural gas systems are required to report emissions from combustion, venting, equipment leaks, and flaring.  The exact list of equipment is specified in the regulatory requirements at 40 CFR 98.232 and is specific to each petroleum and natural gas systems industry segment covered by the GHGRP.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question about what emissions are reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities. The answer provides information about detailed tables related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, but does not address the specific question asked.",1,"The answer does not provide a clear and direct response to the question. While the document provides detailed tables related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, it does not explicitly mention what emissions must be reported by subpart W facilities.",2,0.2782608696,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the specific information about what must be reported by subpart W facilities is not explicitly mentioned, the answer provides relevant information about the document that contains default emission factors and other designations related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.",4,"The answer provides detailed information about the reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities, but does not explicitly mention what emissions must be reported. The sentences fit together well and sound natural as a whole.",522,,
9,Does the current GHGRP data include all U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems?,"The given input contains a lot of irrelevant and garbled information, making it difficult to extract the specific equation related to the reporting for subpart W. It seems that the relevant equation and its explanation are not present in the provided input.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (i) Electronics Manufacturing (subpart I). (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (ix) Manufacture of Electric Transmission and Distribution (subpart SS). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (2) Year and months covered by the report. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (vii) The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–6 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2011 until March 31, 2013. The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–7 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2013 until March 31, 2015 (as part of the annual report for reporting year 2014), except as otherwise specified in Table A–7 of this subpart. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (viii) The facility or supplier must refer to the reporting instructions of the electronic GHG reporting tool regarding standardized conventions for the naming of a parent company. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (ii) The year and months covered by the report. (3) The annual GHG reports. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (4) A change in the GWP for one or more compounds includes the addition to Table A–1 of this subpart of either a chemical-specific or a default GWP that applies to a compound to which no chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart previously applied. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Reporting year means the calendar year during which the GHG data are required to be collected for purposes of the annual GHG report. For example, reporting year 2014 is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the annual report for reporting year 2014 is submitted to EPA on March 31, 2015. Working capacity, for the purposes of subpart TT of this part, means the maximum volume or mass of waste that is actually placed in the landfill from an individual or representative type of container (such as a tank, truck, or roll-off bin) used to convey wastes to the landfill, taking into account that the container may not be able to be 100 percent filled and/or 100 percent emptied for each load. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98. (4) Flares, unless otherwise required by provisions of another subpart of this part to use methodologies in this subpart. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (i) §§ 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (c) Reporting alternatives for units using the four Tiers. You may use any of the applicable reporting alternatives of this paragraph to simplify the unit-level reporting required under paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (iii) The use of this reporting option is documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). Indicate in the Monitoring Plan which units share the common fuel supply and the method used to demonstrate that this alternative reporting option applies. For the small combustion sources, a description of the types of units and the approximate number of units is sufficient. (A) The total number of source operating hours in the reporting year. (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. The annual report shall comply with the data reporting requirements specified in § 98.36(d)(1). (b) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C. (ii) You must notify the EPA of your use of a previously approved alternative method in your annual report. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (n) of this section at the facility level. You must report: (d) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the requirements of subpart C. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), you must report the following information at the facility level: (c) CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions collected and transferred off site under subpart PP of this part (Suppliers of CO<E T=""52"">2), following the requirements of subpart PP. (1) You may use an alternative method from that specified in this subpart provided that you: (6) Neither the validation and approval process nor the failure to validate or obtain approval of an alternative method shall abrogate your responsibility to comply with the requirements of this subpart. (y) If your semiconductor manufacturing facility emits more than 40,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e of GHG emissions, based on your most recently submitted annual report (beginning with the 2015 reporting year) as required in paragraph (c) of this section, from the electronics manufacturing processes subject to reporting under this subpart, you must prepare and submit a triennial (every 3 years) technology assessment report to the Administrator (or an authorized representative) that meets the requirements specified in paragraphs (y)(1) through (6) of this section. Any other semiconductor manufacturing facility may voluntarily submit this report to the Administrator. (1) The first report must be submitted with the annual GHG emissions report that is due no later than March 31, 2017, and subsequent reports must be delivered every 3 years no later than March 31 of the year in which it is due. (i) It must describe how the gases and technologies used in semiconductor manufacturing using 200 mm and 300 mm wafers in the United States have changed in the past 3 years and whether any of the identified changes are likely to have affected the emissions characteristics of semiconductor manufacturing processes in such a way that the default utilization and by-product formation rates or default destruction or removal efficiency factors of this subpart may need to be updated. (3) If, on the basis of the information reported in paragraph (y)(2) of this section, the report indicates that GHG emissions from semiconductor manufacturing may have changed from those represented by the default utilization and by-product formation rates in Tables I–3 or I–4, or the default destruction or removal efficiency values in Table I–16 of this subpart, the report must lay out a data gathering and analysis plan focused on the areas of potential change. The plan must describe the elements in paragraphs (y)(3)(i) and (ii). (4) Multiple semiconductor manufacturing facilities may submit a single consolidated 3-year report as long as the facility identifying information in § 98.3(c)(1) and the certification statement in § 98.3(c)(9) is provided for each facility for which the consolidated report is submitted. Except as provided in this section, all of the terms used in this subpart have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A of this part. If a conflict exists between a definition provided in this subpart and a definition provided in subpart A, the definition in this subpart takes precedence for the reporting requirements in this subpart. All terms used of this subpart have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A of this part. (1) Frequency of reporting under paragraph (a) of this section. The information in paragraphs (a)(2) through (6) of this section must be reported annually. (d) Reporting for missing data. Where missing data have been estimated pursuant to § 98.125, you must report: (i) Reporting of fluorinated GHG products of incomplete combustion (PICs) of fluorinated gases. Each fluorinated gas production facility that destroys fluorinated gases must submit a one-time report by June 30, 2011, that describes any measurements, research, or analysis that it has performed or obtained that relate to the formation of products of incomplete combustion that are fluorinated GHGs during the destruction of fluorinated gases. The report must include the methods and results of any measurement or modeling studies, including the products of incomplete combustion for which the exhaust stream was analyzed, as well as copies of relevant scientific papers, if available, or citations of the papers, if they are not. No new testing is required to fulfill this requirement. (j) Special provisions for reporting years 2011, 2012, and 2013 only. For reporting years 2011, 2012, and 2013, the owner or operator of a facility must comply with paragraphs (j)(1), (j)(2), and (j)(3) of this section.

(b) A facility other than an electric power system that is subject to this part ","EPA does not have an exact estimate of what percent of U.S. emissions are covered under petroleum and natural gas systems at this time.  The petroleum and natural gas systems source category (Subpart W) requires reporting from facilities above an emissions threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e.  It is difficult to quantify what net emissions occurr below the threshold.  In addition, facilities below the threshold may not be directly comparable to facilities over the emission threshold due to differences in the types of emission sources covered.  EPA will continue to analyze the emissions from reports as well as linking the information to the US GHG Inventory to identify what fraction of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are covered by the GHGRP.",1,The answer does not address the question at all and provides irrelevant information.,1,"The passage provides information on calculation methods, equations, and tables related to emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems, but there is no specific mention of the percentage of emissions reported under the GHGRP. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.2476190476,3,The answer attempts to provide information but also conveys uncertainty by stating that there is no specific mention of unlocked subpart W screening spreadsheets from the applicability tool.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides information about various calculation methods and tables related to emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems, but it does not directly answer the question about the percentage of emissions reported under GHGRP.",733,,
11,"How does EPA define a ""facility"" for petroleum and natural gas systems?","The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emissions from the data. It describes the calculation methodology for GHG quantities and the mass in metric tons per year of CO2 resulting from the combustion of petroleum products and natural gas liquids.

However, the direct correlation between the operating factor for associated gas venting and the barrels of crude oil produced is not explicitly addressed in the given input.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year.

Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). bbl means barrel. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Crude oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities. (1) Depending upon the characteristics of the crude stream, it may also include any of the following: (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (iv) Petroleum products that are received or produced at a refinery and subsequently injected into a crude supply or reservoir by the same refinery owner or operator. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Delayed coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is produced in a series of closed, batch system reactors. A delayed coking unit consists of the coke drums and ancillary equipment associated with a single fractionator. Distillate fuel oil means a classification for one of the petroleum fractions produced in conventional distillation operations and from crackers and hydrotreating process units. The generic term distillate fuel oil includes kerosene, kerosene-type jet fuel, diesel fuels (Diesel Fuels No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4), and fuel oils (Fuel Oils No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4). Fluid coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced in a fluidized bed system. The fluid coking unit includes equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for heat recovery on the fluid coking burner exhaust vent. There are two basic types of fluid coking units: A traditional fluid coking unit in which only a small portion of the coke produced in the unit is burned to fuel the unit and the fluid coking burner exhaust vent is directed to the atmosphere (after processing in a CO boiler or other air pollutant control equipment) and a flexicoking unit in which an auxiliary burner is used to partially combust a significant portion of the produced petroleum coke to generate a low value fuel gas that is used as fuel in other combustion sources at the refinery. Heavy Gas Oils are petroleum distillates with an approximate boiling range from 651 °F to 1,000 °F. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Petroleum means oil removed from the earth and the oil derived from tar sands and shale. Petroleum product means all refined and semi-refined products that are produced at a refinery by processing crude oil and other petroleum-based feedstocks, including petroleum products derived from co-processing biomass and petroleum feedstock together, but not including plastics or plastic products. Petroleum products may be combusted for energy use, or they may be used either for non-energy processes or as non-energy products. The definition of petroleum product for importers and exporters excludes waxes. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge.

(iv) An oxygen (O<E T=""52"">2) concentration monitor may be used in lieu of a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 concentrations, in accordance with Equation F–14a or F–14b (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, if the effluent gas stream monitored by the CEMS consists solely of combustion products (i.e., no process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions or CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from sorbent are mixed with the combustion products) and if only fuels that are listed in Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter are combusted in the unit. If the O<E T=""52"">2 monitoring option is selected, the F-factors used in Equations F–14a and F–14b shall be determined according to section 3.3.5 or section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable. If Equation F–14b is used, the hourly moisture percentage in the stack gas shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. (v) Each hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (4) For the purposes of this part, the stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor RATAs required by appendix B to part 75 of this chapter and the annual RATAs of the CERMS required by appendix F to part 60 of this chapter need only be done at one operating level, representing normal load or normal process operating conditions, both for initial certification and for ongoing quality assurance. (C) For CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, and (if applicable) stack gas moisture content, the percentage of source operating hours in which a substitute data value of each parameter was used in the emissions calculations. (31) Total quantity of each liquid fossil fuel combusted in the reporting year, as defined in § 98.6 (gallons) (Equation C–13). (2) Monthly for aluminum production. (c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (1) Monthly clinker production from each kiln at the facility. (2) Annual facility cement production. (3) Annual cement production at the facility. (16) Annual clinker production (metric tons). (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (e) You must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed, on a fab basis, for each process sub-type or process type j, using Equation I–13 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–13 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). If you elect to calculate emissions using the stack test method in paragraph (i) of this section, you must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed on the applicable basis by using an appropriate apportioning factor. For example, when calculating fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG consumed using Equation I–21 of this section, you must substitute the term fij with the appropriate apportioning factor to calculate the total consumption of each fluorinated GHG in tools that are vented to stack systems that are tested. (i) When you are calculating preliminary estimates for the purpose of this paragraph (i)(1), you must consider the subscript “j” in Equations I–8 and I–9, and I–13 of this subpart to mean “stack system” instead of “process sub-type or process type.” For the value of a<E T=""52"">ij, the fraction of input gas i that is used in tools with abatement systems, for use in Equations I–8 and I–9, you may use the ratio of the number of tools using input gas i that have abatement systems that are vented to the stack system for which you are calculating the preliminary estimate to the total number of tools using input gas i that are vented to that stack system, expressed as a decimal fraction. In calculating the preliminary estimates, you must account for the effect of any fluorinated GHG abatement system meeting the definition of abatement system in § 98.98. You may use this approach to determining a<E T=""52"">ij only for this preliminary estimate. (ii) You must use representative data from the previous reporting year to estimate the consumption of input gas i as calculated in Equation I–13 of this subpart and the fraction of input gas i and by-product gas k destroyed in abatement systems for each stack system as calculated by Equations I–24A and I–24B of this subpart. If you were not required to submit an annual report under subpart I for the previous reporting year and data from the previous reporting year are not available, you may estimate the consumption of input gas i and the fraction of input gas i destroyed in abatement systems based on representative operating data from a period of at least 30 days in the current reporting year. When calculating the consumption of input gas i using Equation I–13 of this subpart, the term “f<E T=""52"">ij” is replaced with the ratio of the number of tools using input gas i that are vented to the stack system for which you are calculating the preliminary estimate to the total number of tools in the fab using input gas i, expressed as a decimal fraction. You may use this approach to determining f<E T=""52"">ij only for this preliminary estimate. (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account for the anticipated change in your preliminary estimate. You may account for such a change using a quantifiable metric (e.g., the ratio of the number of tools that are expected to be vented to the stack system in the current year as compared to the previous reporting year, ratio of the expected number of wafer starts in the current reporting year as compared to the previous reporting year), engineering judgment, or other industry standard practice. (iii) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG input gas consumed (in kg of fluorinated GHG emitted per kg of input gas i consumed) in the tools that vent to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–19 of this subpart. If the emissions of input gas i exceed the consumption of input gas i during the sampling period, then equate “E<E T=""52"">is” to the consumption of input gas i and treat the difference between the emissions and consumption of input gas i as a by-product of the other input gases, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. (iv) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG formed as a by-product (in kg of fluorinated GHG per kg of total fluorinated GHG consumed) in the tools vented to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. When calculating the by-product emission factor for an input gas for which emissions exceeded its consumption, exclude the consumption of that input gas from the term “∑(Activity<E T=""52"">if).” (ii) Calculate emissions from consumption of each fluorinated GHG used in tools vented to stack systems that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (i)(2)(iii) of this section, and were not tested according to the procedures in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Calculate emissions using the default utilization and by-product formation rates and equations specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. If you are using a fluorinated GHG not listed in Tables I–11, I–12, I–13, I–14, or I–15 of this subpart, then you must assume utilization and by-product formation rates of zero for that fluorinated GHG. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (1) Base your fab-wide gas-specific heel factors on the trigger point for change out of a container for each container size and type for each gas used. Fab-wide gas-specific heel factors must be expressed as the ratio of the trigger point for change out, in terms of mass, to the initial mass in the container, as determined by paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. (2) The trigger points for change out you use to calculate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your containers. If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas. (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (3) As an alternative to developing apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption using a fab-specific engineering model, you may develop apportioning factors through the use of direct measurement using gas flow meters and weigh scales to measure process sub-type, process type, stack system, or fab-specific input gas consumption. You may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a fab-specific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5). (3) If you develop apportioning factors through the use of direct measurement according to § 98.94(c)(3), calculations and data used to develop each gas apportioning factor. (c) If GHG emissions from an EAF are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (c) Emission factor and emission calculation factor methods. To use the method in this paragraph for batch processes, you must comply with either paragraph (c)(3) of this section (Emission Factor approach) or paragraph (c)(4) of this section (Emission Calculation Factor approach). To use the method in this paragraph for continuous processes, you must first make a preliminary estimate of the emissions from each individual continuous process vent under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If your continuous process operates under different conditions as part of normal operations, you must also define the different operating scenarios and make a preliminary estimate of the emissions from the vent for each operating scenario. Then, compare the preliminary estimate for each continuous process vent (summed across operating scenarios) to the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to determine whether the process vent meets the criteria for using the emission factor method described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section or whether the process vent meets the criteria for using the emission calculation factor method described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. For continuous process vents that meet the criteria for using the emission factor method described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and that have more than one operating scenario, compare the preliminary estimate for each operating scenario to the criteria in (c)(3)(ii) to determine whether an emission factor must be developed for that operating scenario. (1) Preliminary estimate of emissions by process vent. You must estimate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions of fluorinated GHGs for each process vent within each operating scenario of a continuous process using the approaches specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, accounting for any destruction as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. You must determine emissions of fluorinated GHGs by process vent by using measurements, by using calculations based on chemical engineering principles and chemical property data, or by conducting an engineering assessment. You may use previous measurements, calculations, and assessments if they represent current process operating conditions or process operating conditions that would result in higher fluorinated GHG emissions than the current operating conditions and if they were performed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, as applicable. You must document all data, assumptions, and procedures used in the calculations or engineering assessment and keep a record of the emissions determination as required by § 98.127(a). (i) You must determine the flowrate of gas (or volume of gas), partial pressures of condensables, temperature (T), and fluorinated GHG molecular weight (MW<E T=""52"">Fluorinated GHG) at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver. (C) Maximum flow rate, fluorinated GHG emission rate, concentration, or other relevant parameters specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the process vent. (A) The destruction efficiencies of the device that have been demonstrated for the fluorinated GHGs in the vent stream for periods when the process vent is vented to the destruction device. (i) If the calculations under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as well as any subsequent measurements and calculations under this subpart, indicate that the continuous process vent has fluorinated GHG emissions of less than 10,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year, summed across all operating scenarios, then you may comply with either paragraph (c)(3) of this section (Emission Factor approach) or paragraph (c)(4) of this section (Emission Calculation Factor approach). (A) You must conduct emission testing for process-vent-specific emission factor development before the destruction device unless the calculations you performed under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section indicate that the uncontrolled fluorinated GHG emissions that occur during periods when the process vent is not vented to the properly functioning destruction device are less than 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. In this case, you may conduct emission testing after the destruction device to develop a process-vent-specific emission factor. If you do so, you must develop and apply an emission calculation factor under paragraph (c)(4) to estimate emissions during any periods when the process vent is not vented to the properly functioning destruction device. (B) Regardless of the level of uncontrolled emissions, the emission testing for process-vent-specific emission factor development may be conducted on the outlet side of a wet scrubber in place for acid gas reduction, if one is in place, as long as there is no appreciable reduction in the fluorinated GHG. (3) Process-vent-specific emission factor method. For each process vent, conduct an emission test and measure fluorinated GHG emissions from the process and measure the process activity, such as the feed rate, production rate, or other process activity rate, during the test as described in this paragraph (c)(3). Conduct the emission test according to the procedures in § 98.124. All emissions test data and procedures used in developing emission factors must be documented according to § 98.127. If more than one operating scenario applies to the process that contains the subject process vent, you must comply with either paragraph (3)(i) or paragraph (3)(ii) of this section. (ii) Conduct an emissions test for the operating scenario that is expected to have the largest emissions in terms of CO<E T=""52"">2e (considering both activity levels and emission calculation factors) on an annual basis. Also conduct an emissions test for each additional operating scenario that is estimated to emit 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more annually from the vent and whose emission calculation factor differs by 15 percent or more from the emission calculation factor of the operating scenario that is expected to have the largest emissions (or of another operating scenario for which emission testing is performed), unless the difference between the operating scenarios is solely due to the application of a destruction device to emissions under one of the operating scenarios. For any other operating scenarios, adjust the process-vent specific emission factor developed for the operating scenario that is expected to have the largest emissions (or for another operating scenario for which emission testing is performed) using the approach in paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section. (iv) For continuous processes, you must calculate the hourly emission rate of each fluorinated GHG using Equation L–19 of this section and determine the hourly emission rate of each fluorinated GHG per process vent (and per operating scenario, as applicable) for the test run. (v) You must calculate a site-specific, process-vent-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG for each process vent and each operating scenario, in kg of fluorinated GHG per process activity rate (e.g., kg of feed or production), as applicable, using Equation L–20 of this section. For continuous processes, divide the hourly fluorinated GHG emission rate during the test by the hourly process activity rate during the test runs. (vi) If you conducted emissions testing after the destruction device, you must calculate the emissions of each fluorinated GHG for the process vent (and operating scenario, as applicable) using Equation L–21 of this section.

13,How does the petroleum and natural gas systems data reported under the GHGRP compare to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB)?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods for estimating annual GHG emissions from various facilities and suppliers. It outlines specific conditions and thresholds for reporting, as well as the calculation methodologies for different source categories. It provides guidance on how to estimate GHG emissions for the purpose of determining applicability, including the calculation methods for different source categories such as stationary fuel combustion sources and miscellaneous use of carbonates. Additionally, it discusses the conditions under which facilities or suppliers become subject to the reporting requirements and the need for reevaluation in case of any changes that could affect applicability. However, the specific guidance on estimating a worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for determining applicability is not explicitly mentioned in the given input.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (1) Calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is imported and the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is exported during the year. (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (F) For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) that is not also a fluorinated GHG as specified under (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section. If a fluorinated heat transfer fluid does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated heat transfer fluid is a member. (G) For each reported fluorinated GHG and fluorinated heat transfer fluid, report the following identifying information: (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (i) Total quantity of GHG aggregated for all GHG from all applicable supply categories in Table A–5 of this subpart and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section.

(E) Each fluorinated GHG (including those not listed in Table A–1 of this subpart). (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010. Upon request by the Administrator, the records required under this section must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper documents. You must retain the following records, in addition to those records prescribed in each applicable subpart of this part: (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type. These data include but are not limited to the following information in this paragraph (g)(2): (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used.

(iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (3) The annual GHG reports. (5) A written GHG Monitoring Plan. (iv) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall make all information that is collected in conformance with the GHG Monitoring Plan available for review during an audit. Electronic storage of the information in the plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available in hard copy upon request during an audit. (h) Annual GHG report revisions. This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You must also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. (2) With respect to fluorinated GHGs, the expiration of a fluorinated GHG to the destruction efficiency actually achieved. Such destruction does not result in a commercially useful end product. Destruction efficiency means the efficiency with which a destruction device reduces the mass of a greenhouse gas fed into the device. Destruction efficiency, or flaring destruction efficiency, refers to the fraction of the gas that leaves the flare partially or fully oxidized. The destruction efficiency is expressed in Equation A–2 of this section: Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Global warming potential or GWP means the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of one kilogram of a trace substance relative to that of one kilogram of a reference gas (i.e., CO<E T=""52"">2). GWPs for each greenhouse gas are provided in Table A–1 of this subpart. For purposes of the calculations in this part, if the GHG has a chemical-specific GWP listed in Table A–1, use that GWP. Otherwise, use the default GWP provided in Table A–1 for the fluorinated GHG group of which the GHG is a member. Greenhouse gas or GHG means carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2), methane (CH<E T=""52"">4), nitrous oxide (N<E T=""52"">2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and other fluorinated greenhouse gases as defined in this section. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Industrial greenhouse gases means nitrous oxide or any fluorinated greenhouse gas. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel.

(c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (iii) For a gaseous fuel, use Equation C–5 of this section. (iv) Fuel flow meters that measure mass flow rates may be used for liquid or gaseous fuels, provided that the fuel density is used to convert the readings to volumetric flow rates. The density shall be measured at the same frequency as the carbon content. You must measure the density using one of the following appropriate methods. You may use a method published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such a method exists, or you may use industry standard practice. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA), 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). The method(s) used shall be documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (v) Each hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (C) The results of each annual stack test shall be used in the GHG emissions calculations for the year of the test. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate at each set point. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this sect","The GHGRP covers the same sources of emissions in California as CARB, but there are differences in the reporting thresholds as well as how facilities are defined.  CARB has a different definition for onshore production facilities than the GHGRP.  The practical implication is that individual CARB facilities reporting under onshore production may be larger than comparable GHGRP facilities.  However, there will be more facilities in the GHGRP, and those facilities will cover the same emissions as the smaller number of CARB facilities.  It is not expected that the total emissions covered will be different between the GHGRP and CARB.",,,1,"The answer does not address the given evaluation metric of determining whether the ANSWER follows logically from the information contained in the CONTEXT. Instead, it provides information on the calculation methodologies for estimating GHG emissions from various facilities and suppliers, and does not compare the GHGRP data to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB).",2,0.2843137255,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the answer provides information on the GHGRP reporting, it does not directly compare it to the data reported to CARB. The mention of the lack of explicit guidance on estimating a worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks adds some uncertainty to the answer.",4,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of the calculation methodologies for estimating GHG emissions from various facilities and suppliers, including specific conditions and thresholds for reporting. It also discusses the need for reevaluation in case of any changes that could affect applicability. However, it does not explicitly mention the comparison of GHGRP data with data reported to CARB.",911,,
14,"How do I determine ""actual"" temperature and pressure in emission calculations?","The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emission from the data. The equation describes E = COUNT * EF, where E is the emission, COUNT is the number of units, and EF is the emission factor. The difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting in the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets may be due to the specific characteristics and operational differences between transmission compression and underground storage. The content provides detailed descriptions of various emission sources, including reciprocating compressor venting and centrifugal compressor venting, which may have different emission characteristics and therefore require different units for measurement and reporting. The specific units and calculation methods for vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but the detailed descriptions of different emission sources and the associated reporting requirements indicate the complexity and variability of emissions in different environmental contexts.","Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing.

Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale.

However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions.

(A) You must conduct emission testing for process-vent-specific emission factor development before the destruction device unless the calculations you performed under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section indicate that the uncontrolled fluorinated GHG emissions that occur during periods when the process vent is not vented to the properly functioning destruction device are less than 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. In this case, you may conduct emission testing after the destruction device to develop a process-vent-specific emission factor. If you do so, you must develop and apply an emission calculation factor under paragraph (c)(4) to estimate emissions during any periods when the process vent is not vented to the properly functioning destruction device. (2) Identify all batch process vents. (1) Each dual mechanical seal system is operated with the barrier fluid at a pressure that is at all times (except periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction) greater than the pump or agitator stuffing box pressure; or (2) Equipped with a barrier fluid degassing reservoir that is routed to a process or fuel gas system or connected by a closed-vent system to a control device; or Process vent (for the purposes of this subpart only) means a vent from a process vessel or vents from multiple process vessels within a process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a fluorinated GHG-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere (or the point of entry into a control device, if any).

Calculate emissions from wells with plunger lifts and wells without plunger lifts separately. For at least one well of each unique well tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in each sub-basin category (see § 98.238 for the definitions of tubing diameter group, pressure group, and sub-basin category), where gas wells are vented to the atmosphere to expel liquids accumulated in the tubing, install a recording flow meter on the vent line used to vent gas from the well (e.g., on the vent line off the wellhead separator or atmospheric storage tank) according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b).

(g) Well venting during completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing. Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing using Equation W–10A or Equation W–10B of this section. Equation W–10A applies to well venting when the gas flowback rate is measured from a specified number of example completions or workovers and Equation W–10B applies when the gas flowback vent or flare volume is measured for each completion or workover. Completion and workover activities are separated into two periods, an initial period when flowback is routed to open pits or tanks and a subsequent period when gas content is sufficient to route the flowback to a separator or when the gas content is sufficient to allow measurement by the devices specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, regardless of whether a separator is actually utilized. If you elect to use Equation W–10A, you must follow the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(1). If you elect to use Equation W–10B, you must use a recording flow meter installed on the vent line, downstream of a separator and ahead of a flare or vent, to measure the gas flowback. For either equation, emissions must be calculated separately for completions and workovers, for each sub-basin, and for each well type combination identified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. You must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions as specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

If emissions from gas well venting during completions and workovers without hydraulic fracturing are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

You may use the method in paragraph (i)(2) of this section for some blowdown vent stacks at your facility and the method in paragraph (i)(3) of this section for other blowdown vent stacks at your facility. Equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet as determined in paragraph (i)(1) of this section are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section. The requirements in this paragraph (i) do not apply to blowdown vent stack emissions from depressurizing to a flare, over-pressure relief, operating pressure control venting, blowdown of non-GHG gases, and desiccant dehydrator blowdown venting before reloading. (iii) For onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities and LNG import and export equipment, as an alternative to using the procedures in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section, you may elect to sum the annual natural gas emissions as calculated using either Equation W–14A or Equation W–14B of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment type or event type. Calculate the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions for each equipment type or event type using the sums of the total annual natural gas emissions for each equipment type and the calculation method specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. (1) Calculation Method 1. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks. Calculate flashing emissions with a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state, models flashing emissions, and speciates CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that will result when the oil from the separator or non-separator equipment enters an atmospheric pressure storage tank. The following parameters must be determined for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from liquid transferred to tanks: (4) Determine if the storage tank receiving your separator oil has a vapor recovery system. (k) Transmission storage tanks. For vent stacks connected to one or more transmission condensate storage tanks, either water or hydrocarbon, without vapor recovery, in onshore natural gas transmission compression, calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage as specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of this section. If emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (k)(5) of this section.

(o) Centrifugal compressor venting. If you are required to report emissions from centrifugal compressor venting as specified in § 98.232(d)(2), (e)(2), (f)(2), (g)(2), and (h)(2), you must conduct volumetric emission measurements specified in paragraph (o)(1) of this section using methods specified in paragraphs (o)(2) through (5) of this section; perform calculations specified in paragraphs (o)(6) through (9) of this section; and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as specified in paragraph (o)(11) of this section. If emissions from a compressor source are routed to a flare, paragraphs (o)(1) through (11) do not apply and instead you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions as specified in paragraph (o)(12) of this section. If emissions from a compressor source are captured for fuel use or are routed to a thermal oxidizer, paragraphs (o)(1) through (12) do not apply and instead you must calculate and report emissions as specified in subpart C of this part. If emissions from a compressor source are routed to vapor recovery, paragraphs (o)(1) through (12) do not apply. If you are required to report emissions from centrifugal compressor venting at an onshore petroleum and natural gas production facility as specified in § 98.232(c)(19) or an onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facility as specified in § 98.232(j)(8), you must calculate volumetric emissions as specified in paragraph (o)(10); and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as specified in paragraph (o)(11). (1) General requirements for conducting volumetric emission measurements. You must conduct volumetric emission measurements on each centrifugal compressor as specified in this paragraph. Compressor sources (as defined in § 98.238) without manifolded vents must use a measurement method specified in paragraph (o)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. Manifolded compressor sources (as defined in § 98.238) must use a measurement method specified in paragraph (o)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section. (i) Centrifugal compressor source as found measurements. Measure venting from each compressor according to either paragraph (o)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section at least once annually, based on the compressor mode (as defined in § 98.238) in which the compressor was found at the time of measurement, except as specified in paragraphs (o)(1)(i)(C) and (D) of this section. If additional measurements beyond the required annual testing are performed (including duplicate measurements or measurement of additional operating modes), then all measurements satisfying the applicable monitoring and QA/QC that is required by this paragraph (o) must be used in the calculations specified in this section. (A) For a compressor measured in operating-mode, you must measure volumetric emissions from blowdown va","Unless otherwise specified in a calculation requirement, reporters should use average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions as applicable to the respective monitoring methods in 40 CFR 98.233.",3,"The answer provides some relevant information about the calculation methods for determining emissions from different sources, but it does not directly address how to determine 'actual' temperature and pressure in emission calculations, which is the main focus of the question.",1,"The answer does not accurately address the evaluation metric provided. It provides information on how to derive emissions from data, but does not determine whether the answer is entailed by the context or not.",1,0.0617283951,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of the calculation methods for deriving emissions from various sources, including reciprocating compressor venting and centrifugal compressor venting.

15,What are the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available?,"The document mentioned several tables providing emission factors and component counts for various equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. These tables are used to calculate emissions as per the given formulas and guidelines. However, the specific information regarding the monitoring plan and its implementation date is not directly mentioned in the provided input.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. For these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the subparts listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (j) Table A–2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (F) For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) that is not also a fluorinated GHG as specified under (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section. If a fluorinated heat transfer fluid does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated heat transfer fluid is a member. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (viii) Applicable source categories means stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all of the source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart present at the facility. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (6) A written explanation, as required under § 98.3(e), if you change emission calculation methodologies during the reporting period. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (A) Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units). (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (including those not listed in Table A–1 of this subpart). (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31, 2010. (C) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be obtained and installed before April 1, 2010. (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be purchased and delivered by April 1, 2010, include supporting documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was ordered, investigation of alternative suppliers and the dates by which alternative vendors promised delivery, backorder notices or unexpected delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery, and the current expected date of delivery. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1, 2010. The use of best available methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2010. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data from each measurement device shall be documented in the written monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (3) Timing of request. (i) The initial notice of intent must be submitted no later than January 1, 2011, or by the end of the approved use of best available monitoring methods extension in 2010, whichever is earlier. The completed extension request must be submitted to the Administrator no later than February 15, 2011. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (6) Measurement device installation deadline. Any owner or operator that submits both a timely initial notice of intent and a timely completed extension request under paragraph (j)(3) of this section to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by July 1, 2011 unless the extension request under this paragraph (j) is approved by the Administrator before July 1, 2011. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart.

This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section.

(e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (vii) The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–6 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2011 until March 31, 2013.

Crude oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities. (1) Depending upon the characteristics of the crude stream, it may also include any of the following: (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (ii) Small amounts of non-hydrocarbons, such as sulfur and various metals. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (iv) Petroleum products that are received or produced at a refinery and subsequently injected into a crude supply or reservoir by the same refinery owner or operator. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Fossil fuel means natural gas, petroleum, coal, or any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material, for purpose of creating useful heat. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel means solid, liquid or gaseous combustible material. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas.

It excludes organic waste sludges, tank bottoms, spent catalysts, and sulfuric acid. Motor gasoline (finished) means a complex mixture of volatile hydrocarbons, with or without additives, suitably blended to be used in spark ignition engines. Motor gasoline includes conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline, and all types of oxygenated gasoline. Gasoline also has seasonal variations in an effort to control ozone levels. This is achieved by lowering the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of gasoline during the summer driving season. Depending on the region of the country the RVP is lowered to below 9.0 psi or 7.8 psi. The RVP may be further lowered by state regulations. Naphthas (&lt;401 °F) is a generic term applied to a petroleum fraction with an approximate boiling range between 122 °F and 400 °F. The naphtha fraction of crude oil is the raw material for gasoline and is composed largely of paraffinic hydrocarbons.

Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas driven pneumatic pump means a pump that uses pressurized natural gas to move a piston or diaphragm, which pumps liquids on the opposite side of the piston or diaphragm. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels.

This category is usually divided into naphthas less than 401 °F and other oils greater than 401 °F. Petroleum means oil removed from the earth and the oil derived from tar sands and shale. Petroleum coke means a black solid residue, obtained mainly by cracking and carbonizing of petroleum derived feedstocks, vacuum bottoms, tar and pitches in processes such as delayed coking or fluid coking. It consists mainly of carbon (90 to 95 percent), has low ash content, and may be used as a feedstock in coke ovens. This product is also known as marketable coke or catalyst coke. Petroleum product means all refined and semi-refined products that are produced at a refinery by processing crude oil and other petroleum-based feedstocks, including petroleum products derived from co-processing biomass and petroleum feedstock together, but not including plastics or plastic products. Petroleum products may be combusted for energy use, or they may be used either for non-energy processes or as non-energy products. The definition of petroleum product for importers and exporters excludes waxes. Propane is a paraffinic hydrocarbon with molecular formula C<E T=""52"">3H<E T=""52"">8. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Semi-refined petroleum product means all oils requiring further processing. Included in this category are unfinished oils which are produced by the partial refining of crude oil and include the following: Naphthas and lighter oils; kerosene and light gas oils; heavy gas oils; and residuum, and all products that require further processing or the addition of blendstocks. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Still gas means any form or mixture of gases produced in refineries by distillation, cracking, reforming, and other processes. The principal constituents are methane, ethane, ethylene, normal butane, butylene, propane, and propylene. Supplemental fuel means a fuel burned within a petrochemical process that is not produced within the process itself. Sweet gas is natural gas with low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S) and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that does not require (or has already had) acid gas treatment to meet pipeline corrosion-prevention specifications for transmission and distribution. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (10) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography, IBR approved for § 98.74(c), § 98.164(b), § 98.244(b), § 98.254(d), § 98.324(d), § 98.354(g), and § 98.344(b).

Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued.

(4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows.

(a) Stationary fuel combustion sources are devices that combust solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, generally for the purposes of producing electricity, generating steam, or providing useful heat or energy for industrial, commercial, or institutional use, or reducing the volume of waste by removing combustible matter. Stationary fuel combustion sources include, but are not limited to, boilers, simple and combined-cycle combustion turbines, engines, incinerators, and process heaters. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. (d) You are not required to report GHG emissions from pilot lights. A pilot light is a small auxiliary flame that ignites the burner of a combustion device when the control valve opens. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (i) Equation C–2a of this section applies to any type of fuel listed in Table C–1 of the subpart, except for municipal solid waste (MSW). For MSW combustion, use Equation C–2c of this section. (A) If the results of fuel sampling are received monthly or more frequently, then for each unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than or equal to 100 mmBtu/hr (or for a group of units that includes at least one unit of that size), the annual average HHV shall be calculated using Equation C–2b of this section. If multiple HHV determinations are made in any month, average the values for the month arithmetically. (B) If the results of fuel sampling are received less frequently than monthly, or, for a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity less than 100 mmBtu/hr (or a group of such units) regardless of the HHV sampling frequency, the annual average HHV shall either be computed according to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section or as the arithmetic average HHV for all values for the year (including valid samples and substitute data values under § 98.35). (iii) For units that combust municipal solid waste (MSW) and that produce steam, use Equation C–2c of this section. Equation C–2c of this section may also be used for any other solid fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart provided that steam is generated by the unit. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (i) For a solid fuel, use Equation C–3 of this section. (ii) For a liquid fuel, use Equation C–4 of this section. (iii) For a gaseous fuel, use Equation C–5 of this section. (iv) Fuel flow meters that measure mass flow rates may be used for liquid or gaseous fuels, provided that the fuel density is used to convert the readings to volumetric flow rates. The density shall be measured at the same frequency as the carbon content. You must measure the density using one of the following appropriate methods. You may use a method published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such a method exists, or you may use industry standard practice. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA), 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). The method(s) used shall be documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (ii) When the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration is measured on a wet basis, Equation C–6 of this section is used to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 emission rates: (iv) An oxygen (O<E T=""52"">2) concentration monitor may be used in lieu of a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 concentrations, in accordance with Equation F–14a or F–14b (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, if the effluent gas stream monitored by the CEMS consists solely of combustion products (i.e., no process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions or CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from sorbent are mixed with the combustion products) and if only fuels that are listed in Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter are combusted in the unit. If the O<E T=""52"">2 monitoring option is selected, the F-factors used in Equations F–14a and F–14b shall be determined according to section 3.3.5 or section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable. If Equation F–14b is used, the hourly moisture percentage in the stack gas shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. (v) Each hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack. (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E ","If emissions in 2011 are 25,000 tons CO2e or more for all sources covered by the greenhouse gas reporting rule, in this case sources under subparts C and W, then the facility must report. §98.233(s)(1)(i) also indicates that if the calendar year does not overlap with the most recent BOEMRE emissions study publication year, the reporter must use the most recent BOEMRE reported emission data and “adjust emissions based on the operating time for the facility relative to the operating time in the most recent BOEMRE published study.”  Therefore, if reported 2008 emissions, adjusted for any differences in 2011 operating time, are 25,000 tons CO2e or more, then the facility must report for calendar year 2011.",,,,,1,0.2564102564,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the answer does not directly address the question, it provides relevant information about the document's content and the conditions for reporting GHG emissions.",,,699,,

'2000/2205 = Conversion factor to convert tons to metric tons.' - This equation represents a conversion factor for converting tons to metric tons. 4. 'SV = Standard molar volume of gas (0.0240 m3/g-mole at 68 °F and 1 atm).' - This equation defines the standard molar volume of gas. 5. '2000/2205 = Conversion factor for tons to metric tons.' - This equation represents a conversion factor for tons to metric tons. 6. '44/12 = Ratio of molecular weights, CO2to carbon.' - This equation represents the ratio of molecular weights of CO2 to carbon. The text also mentions the calculation and conversion of actual temperature and pressure to standard conditions for the purpose of correcting measured flow rates. It refers to the use of mathematical correlations derived from in-situ calibration to convert remote temperature or total pressure readings to actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter on a daily basis. Additionally, it provides information on the standard temperature and pressure (STP) values, which are defined as either 60 or 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute. The text also includes references to ASTM standards for measuring vapor pressure, relative molecular mass, and heat value of gaseous fuels, as well as the use of consensus-based standards organizations for calibration and measurement methods. The tables provided include emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities, average component counts for major equipment in crude oil production facilities, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. regions.","(3) For orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters, the initial quality assurance consists of in-situ calibration of the differential pressure (delta-P), total pressure, and temperature transmitters. (A) You must demonstrate that measurements at the remote location(s) can, when appropriate correction factors are applied, reliably and accurately represent the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter under all expected ambient conditions. (B) You must make all temperature and/or total pressure measurements in the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section with calibrated gauges, sensors, transmitters, or other appropriate measurement devices. At a minimum, calibrate each of these devices to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, according to one of the following. You may calibrate using a manufacturer's specification or an industry consensus standard. (D) You must use the mathematical correlation(s) derived from the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to convert the remote temperature or the total pressure readings, or both, to the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter, or both, on a daily basis. You shall then use the actual temperature and total pressure values to correct the measured flow rates to standard conditions. Gas conditions mean the actual temperature, volume, and pressure of a gas sample. Gas to oil ratio (GOR) means the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. Standard conditions or standard temperature and pressure (STP), for the purposes of this part, means either 60 or 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute.

(B) If the results of fuel sampling are received less frequently than monthly, or, for a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity less than 100 mmBtu/hr (or a group of such units) regardless of the HHV sampling frequency, the annual average HHV shall either be computed according to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section or as the arithmetic average HHV for all values for the year (including valid samples and substitute data values under § 98.35). (B) You may use an appropriate flow meter calibration method published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such a method exists. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O.

(4) ASTM D2503–92 (Reapproved 2007) Standard Test Method for Relative Molecular Mass (Molecular Weight) of Hydrocarbons by Thermoelectric Measurement of Vapor Pressure (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (7) Annual average carbon content of each type of feedstock consumed. (2) The trigger points for change out you use to calculate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your containers. If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas. (B) Convert the sampling period-beginning, sampling period-ending, and container change-out pressures to masses using Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas (e.g., the Z value yielded by the Redlich, Kwong, Soave equation of state with appropriate values for that gas). Apply the temperatures measured at or nearest to the beginning and end of the sampling period and to the time(s) when containers are changed out, as applicable. For each gas, the consumption during the sampling period is the difference between the masses of the containers of that gas at the beginning and at the end of the sampling period, summed across containers, including containers that are changed out. (1) To calculate emissions caused by the heating of a vessel without a process condenser to a temperature lower than the boiling point, you must use the procedures in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(3) of this chapter. (i) P<E T=""52"">system = Absolute pressure of the receiving vessel. (iii) P<E T=""52"">j= Partial pressure of condensables (including fluorinated GHG) determined at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver. (i) You must determine the flowrate of gas (or volume of gas), partial pressures of condensables, temperature (T), and fluorinated GHG molecular weight (MW<E T=""52"">Fluorinated GHG) at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver. (ii) Measurement of residual gas. The residual weight or pressure you use for paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your cylinders/containers according to § 98.124(k). If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using a form of the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation L–33 of this section, with an appropriately selected Z value. (k) Monitoring for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers. Measure the residual fluorinated GHG in containers received by the facility either using scales or using pressure and temperature measurements. You may use pressure and temperature measurements only in cases where no liquid fluorinated GHG is present in the container. Scales must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent or better of the filled weight (gas plus tare) of the containers of fluorinated GHGs that are typically weighed on the scale. For example, for scales that are generally used to weigh cylinders that contain 115 pounds of gas when full and that have a tare weight of 115 pounds, this equates to ±1 percent of 230 pounds, or ±2.3 pounds. Pressure gauges and thermometers used to measure quantities that are monitored under this paragraph must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent of full scale or better. (1) The vapor pressure of one or more of the compounds is greater than 0.3 kilopascals at 20 °C. (2) The total concentration of the pure compounds constituents having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kilopascals at 20 °C is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight of the total process stream. Vapor pressures may be determined by standard reference texts or ASTM D–2879, (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal pressure which is at least 5 kilopascals below ambient pressure. (2) Monthly volume of the gaseous fuel or feedstock (scf at standard conditions of 68 °F and atmospheric pressure) (Equation P–1). (1) The measured average hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 emission rate during the test (in metric tons per hour). (b) For purposes of Equation T–2 of this section, the mass of the cover gas used over the period p for an individual container shall be estimated by using Equation T–3 of this section: You must calculate and report the annual GHG emissions as prescribed in this section. For calculations that specify measurements in actual conditions, reporters may use a flow or volume measurement system that corrects to standard conditions and determine the flow or volume at standard conditions; otherwise, reporters must use average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions as applicable to the respective monitoring methods in this section. (4) Calculation Method 4. If CEMS or a vent meter is not installed, you may calculate emissions using any standard simulation software package, such as AspenTech HYSYS®, or API 4679 AMINECalc, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state and speciates CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions. A minimum of the following, determined for typical operating conditions over the calendar year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, must be used to characterize emissions: (i) Natural gas feed temperature, pressure, and flow rate. (vi) Solvent pressure, temperature, circulation rate, and weight. (8) For Calculation Method 3, determine annual average volumetric fraction of CO<E T=""52"">2 content in natural gas flowing out of the AGR unit using one of the methods specified in paragraphs (d)(8)(i) through (d)(8)(iii) of this section. (x) Wet natural gas temperature and pressure. (A) Calculate the average flow rate per hour of venting for each unique tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in each sub-basin category by dividing the recorded total annual flow by the recorded time (in hours) for all measured liquid unloading events with venting to the atmosphere. (B) Apply the average hourly flow rate calculated under paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) of this section to all wells in the same pressure group that have the same tubing diameter group, for the number of hours of venting these wells. (ii) Calculate natural gas volumetric emissions at standard conditions using calculations in paragraph (t) of this section. (1) Calculation Method 1. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks. Calculate flashing emissions with a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state, models flashing emissions, and speciates CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that will result when the oil from the separator or non-separator equipment enters an atmospheric pressure storage tank. The following parameters must be determined for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from liquid transferred to tanks: (v) Ambient air temperature. (vi) Ambient air pressure. (i) Flow to storage tank after passing through a separator. Assume that all of the CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 in solution at separator temperature and pressure is emitted from oil sent to storage tanks. You may use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists or you may use an industry standard practice as described in § 98.234(b) to sample and analyze separator oil composition at separator pressure and temperature. (ii) Calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions at standard conditions using calculations in paragraphs (t), (u), and (v) of this section, as applicable to the monitoring equipment used. (4) Calculate natural gas volumetric emissions at standard conditions using calculations in paragraph (t) of this section. (4) Convert GHG volumetric emissions to standard conditions using calculations in paragraph (t) of this section. (ii) Determine the volumetric flow at standard conditions from the common stack using one of the methods specified in paragraph (p)(4)(ii)(A) through (E) of this section. (t) GHG volumetric emissions using actual conditions. If equation parameters in § 98.233 are already determined at standard conditions as provided in the introductory text in § 98.233, which results in volumetric emissions at standard conditions, then this paragraph does not apply. Calculate volumetric emissions at standard conditions as specified in paragraphs (t)(1) or (2) of this section, with actual pressure and temperature determined by engineering estimates based on best available data unless otherwise specified. (1) Calculate natural gas volumetric emissions at standard conditions using actual natural gas emission temperature and pressure, and Equation W–33 of this section for conversions of E<E T=""52"">a,n or conversions of FR<E T=""52"">a (whether sub-sonic or sonic). (2) Calculate GHG volumetric emissions at standard conditions using actual GHG emissions temperature and pressure, and Equation W–34 of this section. You may use either a default compressibility factor of 1, or a site-specific compressibility factor based on actual temperature and pressure conditions. (3) Reporters using 68 °F for standard temperature may use the ratio 519.67/527.67 to convert volumetric emissions from 68 °F to 60 °F. (i) GHG mole fraction in produced natural gas for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. If you have a continuous gas composition analyzer for produced natural gas, you must use an annual average of these values for determining the mole fraction. If you do not have a continuous gas composition analyzer, then you must use an annual average gas composition based on your most recent available analysis of the sub-basin category or facility, as applicable to the emission source. ρ<E T=""52"">i = Density of GHG<E T=""52"">i. Use 0.0526 kg/ft3 for CO<E T=""52"">2 and N<E T=""52"">2O, and 0.0192 kg/ft3 for CH<E T=""52"">4 at 60 °F and 14.7 psia. S<E T=""52"">hl = Amount of CO<E T=""52"">2 retained in hydrocarbon liquids downstream of the storage tank, in metric tons per barrel, under standard conditions. (iv) Calculate GHG volumetric emissions at standard conditions using calculations in paragraph (t) of this section. (b) You must operate and calibrate all flow meters, composition analyzers and pressure gauges used to measure quantities reported in § 98.233 according to the procedures in § 98.3(i) and the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section. You may use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists or you may use an industry standard practice. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the American Gas Association (AGA), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Petroleum Institute (API), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB). (3) Estimate natural gas volumetric emissions at standard conditions using calculations in § 98.233(t). In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each annual report must contain reported emissions and related information as specified in this section. Reporters that use a flow or volume measurement system that corrects to standard conditions as provided in the introductory text in § 98.233 for data elements that are otherwise required to be determined at actual conditions, report gas volumes at standard conditions rather the gas volumes at actual conditions and report the standard temperature and pressure used by the measurement system rather than the actual temperature and pressure. (B) Natural gas feed temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit. (C) Natural gas feed pressure, in pounds per square inch. (I) Solvent pressure, in pounds per square inch. (xii) Pressure of the wet natural gas, in pounds per square inch gauge. (B) Casing pressure, in pounds per square inch absolute. (B) The tubing pressure, in pounds per square inch absolute.

(M) If an oil sub-basin, report average low pressure separator pressure, in pounds per square inch gauge. (iv) Average upstream pipeline pressure, in pounds per square inch gauge. (v) Average downstream pipeline pressure, in pounds per square inch gauge. Operating pressure means the containment pressure that characterizes the normal state of gas or liquid inside a particular process, pipeline, vessel or tank. Pressure groups as applicable to each sub-basin are defined as follows: Less than or equal to 25 psig; greater than 25 psig and less than or equal to 60 psig; greater than 60 psig and less than or equal to 110 psig; greater than 110 psig and less than or equal to 200 psig; and greater than 200 psig. The pressure in the context of pressure groups is either the well shut-in pressure; well casing pressure; or you may use the casing-to-tubing pressure of one well from the same sub-basin multiplied by the tubing pressure for each well in the sub-basin.

Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each annual GHG report shall contain the following information: (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (F) For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) that is not also a fluorinated GHG as specified under (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section. If a fluorinated heat transfer fluid does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated heat transfer fluid is a member. (G) For each reported fluorinated GHG and fluorinated heat transfer fluid, report the following identifying information: (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part.

Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (i) Total quantity of GHG aggregated for all GHG from all applicable supply categories in Table A–5 of this subpart and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. (ii) Quantity of each GHG from each applicable supply category in Table A–5 to this subpart, expressed in metric tons of each GHG. For each reported fluorinated GHG, report the following identifying information: (B) The CAS registry number assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Registry Service. If a CAS registry number is not assigned or is not associated with a single fluorinated GHG, then report an identification number assigned by EPA's Substance Registry Services. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (6) A written explanation, as required under § 98.3(e), if you change emission calculation methodologies during the reporting period. (viii) The facility or supplier must refer to the reporting instructions of the electronic GHG reporting tool regarding standardized conventions for the naming of a parent company. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories.

You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (including those not listed in Table A–1 of this subpart). (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010. Upon request by the Administrator, the records required under this section must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper documents. You must retain the following records, in addition to those records prescribed in each applicable subpart of this part: (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for which GHG emission were calculated. (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type.

(C) Description of the procedures and methods that are used for quality assurance, maintenance, and repair of all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (iii) The owner or operator shall revise the GHG Monitoring Plan as needed to reflect changes in production processes, monitoring instrumentation, and quality assurance procedures; or to improve procedures for the maintenance and repair of monitoring systems to reduce the frequency of monitoring equipment downtime. (iv) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall make all information that is collected in conformance with the GHG Monitoring Plan available for review during an audit. Electronic storage of the information in the plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available in hard copy upon request during an audit. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (h) Annual GHG report revisions. This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (3) A substantive error is an error that impacts the quantity of GHG emissions reported or otherwise prevents the reported data from being validated or verified. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibr",The 10 barrels per day of oil throughput referenced in 98.233(j) is based on annual average daily throughput.,1,The answer is completely irrelevant to the question and does not address the main aspects of the context.,1,"The provided input does not address the inclusion of self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W. The input primarily focuses on the reporting requirements, calculation methodologies, and recordkeeping for GHG emissions from various facilities and suppliers.",1,0.0470588235,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. However, it also includes information that is not directly related to the question and does not provide a clear answer to the specific inquiry about 98.233(j)(1).",4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides information on GHG emissions reporting requirements, calculation methodologies, and recordkeeping for various facilities and suppliers. However, it does not directly address the inclusion of self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W.",1167,,
21,Which calculation from 98.233(o) should be used for centrifugal compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities?,"The document outlines the mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for facilities and suppliers, including the calculation methodologies for different source categories. It specifies the conditions under which facilities and suppliers are required to submit annual GHG reports, and the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. It also provides provisions for discontinuing reporting if emissions fall below certain thresholds for consecutive years. The content details the specific information that must be included in the annual GHG report, such as facility or supplier name, physical address, year and months covered, and emissions data for different GHGs. Additionally, it addresses special provisions for the reporting year 2010, including the use of best available monitoring methods and abbreviated emissions report for certain facilities. The document also emphasizes the importance of verification and recordkeeping, specifying the required records and retention periods. The provided input also includes tables (Table W-1A to Table W-4B) that provide default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities in the onshore petroleum and natural gas industry. These tables offer detailed information on emission factors for different components, survey methods, and regions, which are essential for the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions. This comprehensive data aids in understanding the specific methodologies and factors used in the emission calculations for facilities falling under subpart W. It is evident that the annual GHG report encompasses a wide range of industry segments, as indicated by the detailed emission factors and component counts provided in the tables. Therefore, the report includes emissions data from various industry segments within the onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and storage sectors, among others.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (i) The facility does not meet the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. For these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the subparts listed in Table A–5 of this subpart.

Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part.

(3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (i) Electronics Manufacturing (subpart I). (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (ix) Manufacture of Electric Transmission and Distribution (subpart SS). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (c) Content of the annual report. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each annual GHG report shall contain the following information: (1) Facility name or supplier name (as appropriate), and physical street address of the facility or supplier, including the city, State, and zip code. If the facility does not have a physical street address, then the facility must provide the latitude and longitude representing the geographic centroid or center point of facility operations in decimal degree format. This must be provided in a comma-delimited “latitude, longitude” coordinate pair reported in decimal degrees to at least four digits to the right of the decimal point. (2) Year and months covered by the report.

(v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010. Upon request by the Administrator, the records required under this section must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper documents. You must retain the following records, in addition to those records prescribed in each applicable subpart of this part: (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for which GHG emission were calculated. (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type.

(1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (3) A substantive error is an error that impacts the quantity of GHG emissions reported or otherwise prevents the reported data from being validated or verified. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section.

You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (v) Include a description of the proposed best available monitoring method for estimating GHG emissions during the time prior to installation of the meter. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrat",Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities should refer to §98.233(o)(7) to calculate emissions from centrifugal compressor venting.,1,"The answer does not address the question about which calculation from 98.233(o) should be used for centrifugal compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.

It specifies the calculation methodologies for determining GHG emissions, including CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorinated GHGs, from various source categories. It also provides thresholds for reporting and discontinuing reporting based on annual emissions. Additionally, it details the procedures for reporting, scheduling, verification, and revision of annual GHG reports. The document also includes Table W-1A, which provides emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering and boosting facilities. The emission factors are categorized by region (Eastern U.S. and Western U.S.) and by service type (Gas Service, Light Crude Service, Heavy Crude Service, Gathering Pipelines). These emission factors can be used in the calculation methodologies for determining GHG emissions as specified in the document.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart.

For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year.

(3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG.

(E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (G) For each reported fluorinated GHG and fluorinated heat transfer fluid, report the following identifying information: (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part.

The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process unit shutdown. Include the date of the most recent process unit shutdown, the frequency of shutdowns for this process unit, and the date of the next planned shutdown during which the monitoring equipment can be installed. If there has been a shutdown or if there is a planned process unit shutdown between November 29 of the year during which the change in GWPs is published and April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, include a justification of why the equipment could not be obtained and installed during that shutdown. (a) General.

If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Absorbent circulation pump means a pump commonly powered by natural gas pressure that circulates the absorbent liquid between the absorbent regenerator and natural gas contactor. API means the American Petroleum Institute. Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 means carbon dioxide emissions generated as the result of biomass combustion from combustion units for which emission calculations are required by an applicable part 98 subpart. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Carbon dioxide stream means carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source (e.g. a power plant or other industrial facility) or extracted from a carbon dioxide production well plus incidental associated substances either derived from the source materials and the capture process or extracted with the carbon dioxide. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers.

The final results of Equations W-11A and W-11B (average flow rate in cubic feet per hour under subsonic and sonic flow, respectively) are at actual conditions, and must be converted to standard conditions.",1,The answer does not address the question or provide any relevant information.,1,"The answer does not address the evaluation metric provided in the prompt. It provides information about the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems, including emission factors and calculation methodologies, but does not answer the question about whether the results of Equations W-11A and W-11B are in standard or actual conditions.",1,0.0838323353,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear and detailed overview of the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirements for owners and operators of facilities, including the calculation methodologies for determining GHG emissions and the procedures for reporting, scheduling, verification, and revision of annual GHG reports. However, there are some minor issues with sentence structure and organization that slightly detract from the overall coherence of the answer.",1028,,
23,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","The current GHGRP data covers the petroleum and natural gas systems sector, including onshore petroleum and natural gas production, importers and exporters of petroleum products, and suppliers of industrial greenhouse gases. The data includes requirements for reporting GHG quantities, monitoring plans, and calculation methodologies specified in subparts MM, LL, QQ, OO, and PP. Additionally, the document provides definitions for terms relevant to the sector such as bulk natural gas liquid, centrifugal compressor emissions, city gate, crude oil, degasification system, dehydrator vent emissions, and many others. Furthermore, the document contains several tables providing detailed information on emission factors, component counts, and designation of regions for data collection and reporting, which are crucial for understanding the emission calculations and methodologies used in the petroleum and natural gas systems sector.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (G) For each reported fluorinated GHG and fluorinated heat transfer fluid, report the following identifying information: (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations.

(3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. API means the American Petroleum Institute. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. Crude oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities. (1) Depending upon the characteristics of the crude stream, it may also include any of the following: (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (iv) Petroleum products that are received or produced at a refinery and subsequently injected into a crude supply or reservoir by the same refinery owner or operator.

Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Fossil fuel means natural gas, petroleum, coal, or any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material, for purpose of creating useful heat. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Gaseous fuel means a material that is in the gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions and that is combusted to produce heat and/or energy. GPA means the Gas Processors Association. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Miscellaneous products include all refined petroleum products not defined elsewhere. It includes, but is not limited to, naphtha-type jet fuel (Jet B and JP–4), petrolatum lube refining by-products (aromatic extracts and tars), absorption oils, ram-jet fuel, petroleum rocket fuels, synthetic natural gas feedstocks, waste feedstocks, and specialty oils. It excludes organic waste sludges, tank bottoms, spent catalysts, and sulfuric acid. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas driven pneumatic pump means a pump that uses pressurized natural gas to move a piston or diaphragm, which pumps liquids on the opposite side of the piston or diaphragm. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Petrochemical feedstocks means feedstocks derived from petroleum for the manufacture of chemicals, synthetic rubber, and a variety of plastics. This category is usually divided into naphthas less than 401 °F and other oils greater than 401 °F. Petroleum means oil removed from the earth and the oil derived from tar sands and shale. Petroleum product means all refined and semi-refined products that are produced at a refinery by processing crude oil and other petroleum-based feedstocks, including petroleum products derived from co-processing biomass and petroleum feedstock together, but not including plastics or plastic products. Petroleum products may be combusted for energy use, or they may be used either for non-energy processes or as non-energy products. The definition of petroleum product for importers and exporters excludes waxes. Semi-refined petroleum product means all oils requiring further processing. Included in this category are unfinished oils which are produced by the partial refining of crude oil and include the following: Naphthas and lighter oils; kerosene and light gas oils; heavy gas oils; and residuum, and all products that require further processing or the addition of blendstocks. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere.

API means the American Petroleum Institute. Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 means carbon dioxide emissions generated as the result of biomass combustion from combustion units for which emission calculations are required by an applicable part 98 subpart. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing.

Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Carbon dioxide stream means carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source (e.g. a power plant or other industrial facility) or extracted from a carbon dioxide production well plus incidental associated substances either derived from the source materials and the capture process or extracted with the carbon dioxide. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured.

Fossil fuel means natural gas, petroleum, coal, or any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material, for purpose of creating useful heat. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Gaseous fuel means a material that is in the gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions and that is combusted to produce heat and/or energy. Global warming potential or GWP means the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of one kilogram of a trace substance relative to that of one kilogram of a reference gas (i.e., CO<E T=""52"">2). GWPs for each greenhouse gas are provided in Table A–1 of this subpart. For purposes of the calculations in this part, if the GHG has a chemical-specific GWP listed in Table A–1, use that GWP.

(2) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide into the U.S. from Mexico where the fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide had been admitted into Mexico in bond and were of U.S. origin. (3) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide into the U.S. when transported in a consignment of personal or household effects or in a similar non-commercial situation normally exempted from U.S. Customs attention. (4) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous into U.S. jurisdiction exclusively for U. S. military purposes. Industrial greenhouse gases means nitrous oxide or any fluorinated greenhouse gas.

It includes, but is not limited to, naphtha-type jet fuel (Jet B and JP–4), petrolatum lube refining by-products (aromatic extracts and tars), absorption oils, ram-jet fuel, petroleum rocket fuels, synthetic natural gas feedstocks, waste feedstocks, and specialty oils. It excludes organic waste sludges, tank bottoms, spent catalysts, and sulfuric acid. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Petroleum means oil removed from the earth and the oil derived from tar sands and shale. Petroleum product means all refined and semi-refined products that are produced at a refinery by processing crude oil and other petroleum-based feedstocks, including petroleum products derived from co-processing biomass and petroleum feedstock together, but not including plastics or plastic products. Petroleum products may be combusted for energy use, or they may be used either for non-energy processes or as non-energy products. The definition of petroleum product for importers and exporters excludes waxes. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel.

(1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section.

Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition.

Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers.

Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels.

Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Nat","The gathering and boosting system owner or operator can use a direct measurement of GOR through either onsite measurement or by sending samples out for laboratory analysis. The timing and duration of the sampling/measurement program should follow existing regulatory requirements, which include standard methods published by a consensus-based standards organization or industry standard practices. See 40 CFR 98.234(b). The EPA realizes that owners or operators may calculate GOR for other reasons such as documenting fluid quality for financial transactions, equipment optimization or other state/federal reporting requirements. These values can be used where appropriate.A825. 40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W does not prescribe a specific approach to calculate GOR. Gathering and boosting system operators may use the best approach for their facility, including direct measurement, calculation from other measured data, and standard estimation measures. We note that within the EPA’s 2016 updates to New Source Performance Standards for the oil and natural gas sector, GOR is defined as the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to a standard temperature and pressure. See 40 CFR 60.5430a.",1,"The answer is completely irrelevant to the question about determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines. The answer talks about mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for facilities and suppliers, and does not provide any information about GOR calculation.",1,The answer does not provide any information about how to determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines. It only discusses the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirements and calculation methodologies for GHG emissions.,1,0.2088607595,2,The answer attempts to provide information but conveys some uncertainty by using phrases like 'the given input contains information' and 'the text also mentions'.,3,"The answer partially addresses the question, but lacks coherence in some parts and could be improved for better clarity and flow.",1110,,
26,"My gathering pipeline is exempt based on Gas to Oil Ratio. Does the exemption only apply to the pipeline itself, or is all equipment along the pipeline excluded as well?","The given input does not directly provide the definition of a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems by the EPA. However, it does contain relevant information in the form of tables. The EPA defines a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. The definition also includes specific equipment criteria such as being attached to a foundation, residing at the same location for more than 12 consecutive months, or being located at a seasonal facility and operating during the full annual operating period of the seasonal facility. The provided tables, such as Table W-1A, Table W-1B, Table W-1C, Table W-1D, Table W-1E, and Table W-2, contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities related to petroleum and natural gas systems. These tables are essential for understanding the emission factors and component counts associated with different types of equipment and facilities, which are crucial for determining compliance with EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part.

It includes, but is not limited to, naphtha-type jet fuel (Jet B and JP–4), petrolatum lube refining by-products (aromatic extracts and tars), absorption oils, ram-jet fuel, petroleum rocket fuels, synthetic natural gas feedstocks, waste feedstocks, and specialty oils. It excludes organic waste sludges, tank bottoms, spent catalysts, and sulfuric acid. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas driven pneumatic pump means a pump that uses pressurized natural gas to move a piston or diaphragm, which pumps liquids on the opposite side of the piston or diaphragm. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Petrochemical feedstocks means feedstocks derived from petroleum for the manufacture of chemicals, synthetic rubber, and a variety of plastics. This category is usually divided into naphthas less than 401 °F and other oils greater than 401 °F. Petroleum means oil removed from the earth and the oil derived from tar sands and shale. Petroleum product means all refined and semi-refined products that are produced at a refinery by processing crude oil and other petroleum-based feedstocks, including petroleum products derived from co-processing biomass and petroleum feedstock together, but not including plastics or plastic products. Petroleum products may be combusted for energy use, or they may be used either for non-energy processes or as non-energy products. The definition of petroleum product for importers and exporters excludes waxes. (1) The equipment is attached to a foundation. (2) The equipment or a replacement resides at the same location for more than 12 consecutive months. (3) The equipment is located at a seasonal facility and operates during the full annual operating period of the seasonal facility, remains at the facility for at least two years, and operates at that facility for at least three months each year. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Semi-refined petroleum product means all oils requiring further processing. Included in this category are unfinished oils which are produced by the partial refining of crude oil and include the following: Naphthas and lighter oils; kerosene and light gas oils; heavy gas oils; and residuum, and all products that require further processing or the addition of blendstocks. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Still gas means any form or mixture of gases produced in refineries by distillation, cracking, reforming, and other processes. The principal constituents are methane, ethane, ethylene, normal butane, butylene, propane, and propylene. Sweet gas is natural gas with low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S) and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that does not require (or has already had) acid gas treatment to meet pipeline corrosion-prevention specifications for transmission and distribution. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Ventilation system means a system that is used to control the concentration of methane and other gases within mine working areas through mine ventilation, rather than a mine degasification system. A ventilation system consists of fans that move air through the mine workings to dilute methane concentrations. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wellhead means the piping, casing, tubing and connected valves protruding above the earth's surface for an oil and/or natural gas well. The wellhead ends where the flow line connects to a wellhead valve. Wellhead equipment includes all equipment, permanent and portable, located on the improved land area (i.e. well pad) surrounding one or multiple wellheads. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (10) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography, IBR approved for § 98.74(c), § 98.164(b), § 98.244(b), § 98.254(d), § 98.324(d), § 98.354(g), and § 98.344(b).

(3) Irrigation pumps at agricultural operations. (i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (v) May be used for natural gas combustion in a unit of any size, in cases where the annual natural gas consumption is obtained from fuel billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. (ii) May be used in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr for the combustion of natural gas and/or distillate fuel oil. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (i) Use Equation C–8a to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms. (ii) Use Equation C–8b to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu. (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (4) Annual natural gas usage (therms/year) (Equation C–1a of § 98.33). (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). (c) Number of facility and unit operating hours in calendar year. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), you must report the following information at the facility level: (1) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (5) ASTM D3238–95 (Reapproved 2005) Standard Test Method for Calculation of Carbon Distribution and Structural Group Analysis of Petroleum Oils by the n-d-M Method (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (2) Annual facility cement production. (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (v) If your facility has multiple fabs with a single centralized fluorinated-GHG supply system, you must verify that your apportioning model can apportion fluorinated GHG consumption among the fabs by adhering to the procedures in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (c)(2)(iv) of this section. (a) Annual manufacturing capacity of each fab at your facility used to determine the annual manufacturing capacity of your facility in Equation I–5 of this subpart. (p) Inventory and description of all abatement systems through which fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O flow at your facility and for which you are claiming destruction or removal efficiency, including: (1) The number of abatement systems controlling emissions for each process sub-type, or process type, as applicable, for each gas used in the process sub-type or process type. (q) For all abatement systems through which fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O flow at your facility, for which you are reporting controlled emissions, the following: (3) If you use default destruction or removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/o","As defined in 40 CFR 98.230(a)(9), the exclusion only applies to individual gathering pipelines with a GOR of less than 300 scf/STB, not any other part of the gathering and boosting system.",1,"The given input does not directly provide information about the Gas to Oil Ratio exemption for gathering pipelines. Therefore, the relevance of the answer to the question is completely lacking.",3,"The answer provides relevant information about the definition of a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems by the EPA, but does not directly answer the question about whether the exemption applies only to the pipeline or all equipment along the pipeline. The provided tables are helpful for understanding emission factors and component counts for different types of equipment and facilities, but do not provide a clear answer to the question. Therefore, the score is 3.",1,0.0977777778,,,4,"Based on the provided information, the exemption for Gas to Oil Ratio applies to the gathering pipeline itself. However, it is unclear if all equipment along the pipeline is excluded as well. Therefore, the coherence of the answer is mostly coherent.",1392,,
27,Can facilities covered by the Subpart W Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting industry segment use Subpart C emission factors for calculating combustion emissions?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emissions from the data. The relevant equations include CO2e = Carbon dioxide equivalent, metric tons/year, CE = Calibration error (%), EF = Fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor, from Table C–1 of this subpart (kg CO2/mmBtu), HHV = Default high heat value of the fuel, from Table C–1 of this subpart (mmBtu per mass or volume, as applicable), and EF = Fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor for natural gas, from Table C–1 of this subpart (kg CO2/mmBtu). The extraction explains that these equations represent important parameters related to emissions and fuel characteristics in the context of environmental regulations. The text also indicates that not all petroleum and natural gas system facilities are subject to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, as they are only required to report if they meet specific criteria outlined in the regulations.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (13) An indication of whether the facility includes one or more plant sites that have been assigned a “plant code” (as defined under § 98.6) by either the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration or by the EPA's Clean Air Markets Division. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010.

Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers.

Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit.

In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (iii) For a gaseous fuel, use Equation C–5 of this section. (iv) Fuel flow meters that measure mass flow rates may be used for liquid or gaseous fuels, provided that the fuel density is used to convert the readings to volumetric flow rates. The density shall be measured at the same frequency as the carbon content. You must measure the density using one of the following appropriate methods. You may use a method published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such a method exists, or you may use industry standard practice. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA), 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). The method(s) used shall be documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (v) May be used for natural gas combustion in a unit of any size, in cases where the annual natural gas consumption is obtained from fuel billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. (F) The installed gas or stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors are required, either by an applicable Federal or State regulation or by the unit's operating permit, to undergo periodic quality assurance testing in accordance with either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (C) The CO<E T=""52"">2 and stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors meet the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(E) and (b)(4)(ii)(F) of this section. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation. (i) Use Equation C–8a to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms. (ii) Use Equation C–8b to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu. (C) For Tier 4 units, use the best available information (e.g., fuel feed rate measurements, fuel heating values, engineering analysis) to estimate the value of (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each type of fuel. Instrumentation used to make these estimates is not subject to the calibration requirements of § 98.3(i) or to the QA requirements of § 98.34. (5) When multiple fuels are combusted during the reporting year, sum the fuel-specific results from Equations C–8, C–8a, C–8b, C–9a, C–9b, or C–10 of this section (as applicable) to obtain the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions, in metric tons. (iii) Calculate the annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion using Equation C–13 of this section. If two or more types of fossil fuel are combusted during the year, perform a separate calculation with Equation C–13 of this section for each fuel and sum the results. The CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data for stationary fuel combustion sources shall be monitored as follows: (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (6) You must use one of the following appropriate fuel sampling and analysis methods. The HHV may be calculated using chromatographic analysis together with standard heating values of the fuel constituents, provided that the gas chromatograph is operated, maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, you may use a method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists, or you may use industry standard practice to determine the high heat values.

(A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (C) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil and for biogas, sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (F) For mixtures (blends) of solid fuels, weekly sampling is required to obtain composite samples, which are analyzed monthly. For blends of liquid fuels, and for gas mixtures consisting only of natural gas and biogas, sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. For gas mixtures that contain gases other than natural gas (including biogas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (4) You must use one of the following appropriate fuel sampling and analysis methods. The results of chromatographic analysis of the fuel may be used, provided that the gas chromatograph is operated, maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, you may use a method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists, or you may use industry standard practice to determine the carbon content and molecular weight (for gaseous fuel) of the fuel.

29,"What is the definition of  ""fractionate"" and ""fractionation"" in 98.230(a)(3)?","The document outlines the calculation methodologies for determining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including CO2e, CH4, and N2O, from various source categories such as stationary fuel combustion units and miscellaneous uses of carbonates. It provides specific equations and methods for calculating emissions from different types of fuel combustion, and it also mentions the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for certain parameters that cannot reasonably be measured according to monitoring and QA/QC requirements. The use of BAMM is allowed for a specific period, and there are provisions for requesting extensions for its use. Additionally, the document specifies reporting requirements and conditions for facilities based on their emissions levels, with thresholds set at 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year. Overall, the document provides detailed guidance on how to calculate and report GHG emissions, including the use of BAMM, and the conditions under which facilities may discontinue complying with reporting requirements.","(2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section.

Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (7) A brief description of each “best available monitoring method” used, the parameter measured using the method, and the time period during which the “best available monitoring method” was used, if applicable. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (A) Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units). (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31, 2010. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1, 2010. The use of best available methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2010. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (3) A substantive error is an error that impacts the quantity of GHG emissions reported or otherwise prevents the reported data from being validated or verified. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (3) Timing of request. (i) The initial notice of intent must be submitted no later than January 1, 2011, or by the end of the approved use of best available monitoring methods extension in 2010, whichever is earlier. The completed extension request must be submitted to the Administrator no later than February 15, 2011. (v) Include a description of the proposed best available monitoring method for estimating GHG emissions during the time prior to installation of the meter. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (G) Finally, add the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the unit. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (A) Use the hourly heat input data from appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, together with Equation G–4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates, in units of tons/hr; (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (A) Calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons, using Equation LM–11 in § 75.19(c)(4)(iii) of this chapter. (B) Sum the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions values over the entire reporting year to obtain the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (A) Use Equation F–11 or F–2 (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates from the CEMS data. If an O<E T=""52"">2 monitor is used, convert the hourly average O<E T=""52"">2 readings to CO<E T=""52"">2 using Equation F–14a or F–14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (as applicable), before applying Equation F–11 or F–2. (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (iv) For units that qualify to use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methods in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(iii) of this section, if both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, separate calculation and reporting of the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) is optional, only for the 2010 reporting year, as provided in § 98.3(c)(12). (b) Use of the four tiers. Use of the four tiers of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methodologies described in paragraph (a) of this section is subject to the following conditions, requirements, and restrictions: (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (c) Calculation of CH<E T=""54"">4 and N<E T=""54"">2O emissions from stationary combustion sources. You must calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions only for units that are required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the calculation methodologies of this subpart and for only those fuels that are listed in Table C–2 of this subpart. (2) Use Equation C–9a of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 2 Equation C–2a of this section to estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions. Use the same values for fuel consumption and HHV that you use for the Tier 2 calculation. (i) If only one type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart is combusted during the reporting year, substitute the cumulative annual heat input from combustion of the fuel into Equation C–10 of this section to calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 or N<E T=""52"">2O emissions. For units in the Acid Rain Program and units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, obtain the cumulative annual heat input directly from the electronic data reports required under § 75.64 of this chapter. For Tier 4 units, use the best available information, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate the cumulative annual heat input (HI)<E T=""52"">A. (D) Units in the Acid Rain Program and other units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter may use the best available information described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each fuel type, whenever fuel-specific heat input values cannot be directly obtained from the electronic data reports under § 75.64 of this chapter. (5) When multiple fuels are combusted during the reporting year, sum the fuel-specific results from Equations C–8, C–8a, C–8b, C–9a, C–9b, or C–10 of this section (as applicable) to obtain the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions, in metric tons. (D) Sum the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions across all component fuels to obtain the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions for the blend. Similarly sum the annual N<E T=""52"">2O emissions across all component fuels to obtain the annual N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for the blend. Report these annual emissions totals. (2) The total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions reported for the unit shall include the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion process and the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the sorbent. (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). (ii) Sum all of the hourly V<E T=""52"">CO2h values for the reporting year, to obtain V<E T=""52"">total, the total annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted. (iii) Calculate the annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion using Equation C–13 of this section. If two or more types of fossil fuel are combusted during the year, perform a separate calculation with Equation C–13 of this section for each fuel and sum the results. (vi) Calculate the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in metric tons, by multiplying the results obtained from Equation C–14 of this section by the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in metric tons, as determined: (C) From the electronic data report required under § 75.64 of this chapter, for units in the Acid Rain Program and other units using CEMS to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions according to part 75 of this chapter. However, before calculating the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, multiply the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by 0.91 to convert from short tons to metric tons. (i) Use an applicable CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation method in this section to quantify the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the u",It is EPA’s intention for the purpose of Subpart W to follow general industry parlance whereby “fractionate” and “fractionation” refers to the separation of NGLs into individual chemical species or commercial products.,,,1,"The question asks for the definition of 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in 98.230(a)(3), but the provided context does not contain any mention of these terms or the specified section number.",1,0.0941176471,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The definition in 98.230(a)(3) does not mention the terms 'fractionate' or 'fractionation', so the answer is mostly coherent but lacks some accuracy.",1041,,
30,"If fuel gas lines are not owned or operated by a gas processing facility, but are on the gas processing facility property, do the fuel gas lines need to be monitored for equipment leaks?","The document provides detailed information on the mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of facilities, particularly in the petroleum and natural gas systems. It outlines the calculation methodologies for determining annual GHG emissions, including CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorinated GHGs. The reporting schedule and content for the annual GHG report are specified, along with provisions for discontinuing reporting under certain conditions, verification of reported GHG emissions, and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, special provisions for the reporting year 2010 and procedures for submitting revised annual GHG reports in case of substantive errors are addressed. The document also includes several tables providing default emission factors and average component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering/boosting equipment, and crude oil production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. These tables offer valuable data for calculating GHG emissions from the petroleum and natural gas systems. However, the comparison of the data reported under the GHGRP to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. For these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the subparts listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (1) Calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is imported and the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is exported during the year. (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012.

The completed extension request must be submitted to the Administrator no later than February 15, 2011. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (iv) Petroleum products that are received or produced at a refinery and subsequently injected into a crude supply or reservoir by the same refinery owner or operator. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties.

Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wellhead means the piping, casing, tubing and connected valves protruding above the earth's surface for an oil and/or natural gas well. The wellhead ends where the flow line connects to a wellhead valve. Wellhead equipment includes all equipment, permanent and portable, located on the improved land area (i.e. well pad) surrounding one or multiple wellheads.

(4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (i) Total quantity of GHG aggregated for all GHG from all applicable supply categories in Table A–5 of this subpart and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. (6) A written explanation, as required under § 98.3(e), if you change emission calculation methodologies during the reporting period. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (iii) Engineering calculations. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for which GHG emission were calculated. (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type. These data include but are not limited to the following information in this paragraph (g)(2): (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used. For data required by § 98.5(b) to be entered into verification software specified in § 98.5(b), maintain the entered data in the format generated by the verification software according to § 98.5(b). (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (iii) The results of all required analyses for high heat value, carbon content, and other required fuel or feedstock parameters. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (B) Explanation of the processes and methods used to collect the necessary data for the GHG calculations. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data from each measurement device shall be documented in the written monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (3) For orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters, the initial quality assurance consists of in-situ calibration of the differential pressure (delta-P), total pressure, and temperature transmitters. (ii) In cases where there are only two transmitters (i.e., differential pressure and either temperature or total pressure) in the immediate vicinity of the flow meter's primary element (e.g., the orifice plate), or when there is only a differential pressure transmitter in close proximity to the primary element, calibration of these existing transmitters to a CE of 2.0 percent or less at each measurement point is still required, in accordance with paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section; alternatively, when two transmitters are calibrated, the results are acceptable if the sum of the CE values for the two transmitters at each calibration level does not exceed 4.0 percent. However, note that installation and calibration of an additional transmitter (or transmitters) at the flow monitor location to measure temperature or total pressure or both is not required in these cases. Instead, you may use assumed values for temperature and/or total pressure, based on measurements of these parameters at a remote location (or locations), provided that the following conditions are met: (A) You must demonstrate that measurements at the remote location(s) can, when appropriate correction factors are applied, reliably and accurately represent the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter under all expected ambient conditions. (B) You must make all temperature and/or total pressure measurements in the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section with calibrated gauges, sensors, transmitters, or other appropriate measurement devices. At a minimum, calibrate each of these devices to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, according to one of the following. You may calibrate using a manufacturer's specification or an industry consensus standard. (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You must also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (D) You must use the mathematical correlation(s) derived from the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to convert the remote temperature or the total pressure readings, or both, to the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter, or both, on a daily basis. You shall then use the actual temperature and total pressure values to correct the measured flow rates to standard conditions. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (iii) Engineering calculations. Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 means carbon dioxide emissions generated as the result of biomass combustion from combustion units for which emission calculations are required by an applicable part 98 subpart. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Carbon dioxide stream means carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source (e.g. a power plant or other industrial facility) or extracted from a carbon dioxide production well plus incidental associated substances either derived from the source materials and the capture process or extracted with the carbon dioxide. Continuous emission monitoring system or CEMS means the total equipment required to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings recorded at least once every 15 minutes, a permanent record of gas concentrations, pollutant emission rates, or gas volumetric flow rates from stationary sources. Destruction efficiency means the efficiency with which a destruction device reduces the mass of a greenhouse gas fed into the device. Destruction efficiency, or flaring destruction efficiency, refers to the fraction of the gas that leaves the flare partially or fully oxidized. The destruction efficiency is expressed in Equation A–2 of this section: Gas conditions mean the actual temperature, volume, and pressure of a gas sample. Global warming potential or GWP means the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of one kilogram of a trace substance relative to that of one kilogram of a reference gas (i.e., CO<E T=""52"">2). GWPs for each greenhouse gas are provided in Table A–1 of this subpart. For purposes of the calculations in this part, if the GHG has a chemical-specific GWP listed in Table A–1, use that GWP. Otherwise, use the default GWP provided in Table A–1 for the fluorinated GHG group of which the GHG is a member. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Standard conditions or standard temperature and pressure (STP), for the purposes of this part, means either 60 or 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute.

Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calc","The Rule states in §98.230(a) that the onshore natural gas processing industry includes all plants that fractionate, as well as all plants that do not fractionate that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.  Only those non-fractionating facilities with an annual average throughput of less than 25 MMscf per day would not be subject to reporting under subpart W even if the reporting threshold is triggered in Subpart C.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question.,1,The answer provided is not relevant to the question asked.

It specifies the conditions and methods for calculating annual emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorinated GHGs in metric tons from various source categories. The document also provides specific equations and procedures for calculating GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year threshold for different types of facilities and suppliers. Additionally, it mentions the use of best available monitoring methods and the certification of GHG emissions reports by designated representatives. However, the specific requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available are not explicitly mentioned in the provided input.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (1) Calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is imported and the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is exported during the year. (2) Convert the mass of each imported and each GHG exported from paragraph (f)(1) of this section to metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part).

You must also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Destruction efficiency means the efficiency with which a destruction device reduces the mass of a greenhouse gas fed into the device. Destruction efficiency, or flaring destruction efficiency, refers to the fraction of the gas that leaves the flare partially or fully oxidized. The destruction efficiency is expressed in Equation A–2 of this section: Fluorinated greenhouse gas means sulfur hexafluoride (SF<E T=""52"">6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF<E T=""52"">3), and any fluorocarbon except for controlled substances as defined at 40 CFR part 82, subpart A and substances with vapor pressures of less than 1 mm of Hg absolute at 25 degrees C. With these exceptions, “fluorinated GHG” includes but is not limited to any hydrofluorocarbon, any perfluorocarbon, any fully fluorinated linear, branched or cyclic alkane, ether, tertiary amine or aminoether, any perfluoropolyether, and any hydrofluoropolyether.

Gas monitor means an instrument that continuously measures the concentration of a particular gaseous species in the effluent of a stationary source. Global warming potential or GWP means the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of one kilogram of a trace substance relative to that of one kilogram of a reference gas (i.e., CO<E T=""52"">2). GWPs for each greenhouse gas are provided in Table A–1 of this subpart. For purposes of the calculations in this part, if the GHG has a chemical-specific GWP listed in Table A–1, use that GWP. Otherwise, use the default GWP provided in Table A–1 for the fluorinated GHG group of which the GHG is a member. Greenhouse gas or GHG means carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2), methane (CH<E T=""52"">4), nitrous oxide (N<E T=""52"">2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and other fluorinated greenhouse gases as defined in this section. Methane correction factor means an adjustment factor applied to the methane generation rate to account for portions of the landfill that remain aerobic.

(c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (A) If the results of fuel sampling are received monthly or more frequently, then for each unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than or equal to 100 mmBtu/hr (or for a group of units that includes at least one unit of that size), the annual average HHV shall be calculated using Equation C–2b of this section. If multiple HHV determinations are made in any month, average the values for the month arithmetically. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (iii) For a gaseous fuel, use Equation C–5 of this section. (iv) Fuel flow meters that measure mass flow rates may be used for liquid or gaseous fuels, provided that the fuel density is used to convert the readings to volumetric flow rates. The density shall be measured at the same frequency as the carbon content. You must measure the density using one of the following appropriate methods. You may use a method published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such a method exists, or you may use industry standard practice. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA), 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). The method(s) used shall be documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (ii) When the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration is measured on a wet basis, Equation C–6 of this section is used to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 emission rates: (iii) If the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration is measured on a dry basis, a correction for the stack gas moisture content is required. You shall either continuously monitor the stack gas moisture content using a method described in § 75.11(b)(2) of this chapter or use an appropriate default moisture percentage. For coal, wood, and natural gas combustion, you may use the default moisture values specified in § 75.11(b)(1) of this chapter. Alternatively, for any type of fuel, you may determine an appropriate site-specific default moisture value (or values), using measurements made with EPA Method 4—Determination Of Moisture Content In Stack Gases, in appendix A–3 to part 60 of this chapter. Moisture data from the relative accuracy test audit (RATA) of a CEMS may be used for this purpose. If this option is selected, the site-specific moisture default value(s) must represent the fuel(s) or fuel blends that are combusted in the unit during normal, stable operation, and must account for any distinct difference(s) in the stack gas moisture content associated with different process operating conditions. For each site-specific default moisture percentage, at least nine Method 4 runs are required, except where the option to use moisture data from a RATA is selected, and the applicable regulation allows a single moisture determination to represent two or more RATA runs. In that case, you may base the site-specific moisture percentage on the number of moisture runs allowed by the RATA regulation. Calculate each site-specific default","Since the throughput of the facility was identified in the question as 30 MMscf per day throughput capacity, this exceeds the exclusion identified in the §98.230(a)(3) for processing facilities that do not fractionate.  Therefore, this facility falls under the onshore natural gas processing industry segment definition as defined in §98.230(a)(3) and these emissions would be included in the applicability determination for your facility.  (If the throughput were less than 25 MMscf this source would not have been considered in the applicability determination for the facility.)  However, based on the information provided, since the processing facility has less than 25,000 metric tons CO2e in combined emissions from stationary combustion, flaring, vented, and fugitive sources, the facility does not need to report under subpart W.  Both the 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold (from §98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day annual average throughput (from §98.230(a)(3)) are considered when determining subpart W applicability for a natural gas processing facility.",,,1,"The provided context does not contain information about the precedence of the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold and the 25 MMscf per day throughput for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility.",2,0.2677165354,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the answer provides information on GHG reporting requirements and calculation methodologies, it does not directly answer the question on which takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability. However, the answer does mention the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year threshold and provides equations and procedures for calculating GHG quantities for comparison to this threshold.",4,"The answer provides a clear and detailed explanation of the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirements for facilities and suppliers, including the calculation methodologies for determining GHG emissions. However, there are some instances where the language is technical and may be difficult for a layperson to understand.",904,,
34,"Under subpart W, are we required to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane?","The document mentioned several calculation methods for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare. It includes equations for calculating the mass of CO2 resulting from the combustion of petroleum products and natural gas liquids, gas to oil ratio, sendout, destruction efficiency, and various equations for calculating the volume of liquid and gaseous fuels combusted. Additionally, it provides details on the Tracer Gas Protocol for determining volumetric flow rate, monitoring requirements for gas or stack volumetric flow rate, and measuring residual gas amounts in cylinders. The document also discusses the calculation and measurement of emissions from venting residual fluorinated GHGs, as well as the reporting requirements for emissions from the petroleum and natural gas industry segments. The relevant tables provide default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, crude oil production equipment, natural gas processing plants, natural gas transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage.","(e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. Air injected flare means a flare in which air is blown into the base of a flare stack to induce complete combustion of gas. Destruction efficiency means the efficiency with which a destruction device reduces the mass of a greenhouse gas fed into the device. Destruction efficiency, or flaring destruction efficiency, refers to the fraction of the gas that leaves the flare partially or fully oxidized. The destruction efficiency is expressed in Equation A–2 of this section: Flare means a combustion device, whether at ground level or elevated, that uses an open flame to burn combustible gases with combustion air provided by uncontrolled ambient air around the flame. Gas to oil ratio (GOR) means the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production.

(4) Volume of each liquid feedstock used in month (gallons of feedstock) (Equation G–2 of § 98.73). (i) The sum of annual emissions of fluorinated GHGs from all of the combined stack systems that are not tested in the fab must be less than 10,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. (ii) Calculate emissions from consumption of each fluorinated GHG used in tools vented to stack systems that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (i)(2)(iii) of this section, and were not tested according to the procedures in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Calculate emissions using the default utilization and by-product formation rates and equations specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. If you are using a fluorinated GHG not listed in Tables I–11, I–12, I–13, I–14, or I–15 of this subpart, then you must assume utilization and by-product formation rates of zero for that fluorinated GHG. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (1) Base your fab-wide gas-specific heel factors on the trigger point for change out of a container for each container size and type for each gas used. Fab-wide gas-specific heel factors must be expressed as the ratio of the trigger point for change out, in terms of mass, to the initial mass in the container, as determined by paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. (2) The trigger points for change out you use to calculate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your containers. If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas. (i) For containers with a maximum storage capacity of less than 9.08 kg (20 lbs) of gas, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 50 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type. (5) You must re-calculate a fab-wide gas-specific heel factor if you execute a process change to modify the trigger point for change out for a gas and container type that differs by more than 5 percent from the previously used trigger point for change out for that gas and container type. (i) Measure fluorinated GHG consumption using gas flow meters, scales, or pressure measurements. Measure the mass or pressure, as applicable, at the beginning and end of the sampling period and when containers are changed out. If you elect to measure gas consumption using pressure (i.e., because the gas is stored in a location above its critical temperature) you must estimate consumption as specified in paragraphs (j)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. (3) Certification that the gas(es) you selected under § 98.94(c)(2)(ii) for each fab corresponds to the largest quantity(ies) consumed, on a mass basis, of fluorinated GHG used at your fab during the reporting year for which you are required to apportion. (ii) A planned analysis of the effect on overall facility emissions using a representative gas-use profile for a 200 mm, 300 mm, or 450 mm fab (depending on which technology is under consideration). (2) Sample calculations used for developing the gas apportioning factors (f<E T=""52"">ij) for the two fluorinated GHGs used at your facility in the largest quantities, on a mass basis, during the reporting year. (3) The sum of the emissions of all fluorinated GHGs that are considered intermittent low use gases does not exceed 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e for the fab for that year, as calculated using the procedures specified in § 98.93(i)(1) of this subpart. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (i) You must determine the flowrate of gas (or volume of gas), partial pressures of condensables, temperature (T), and fluorinated GHG molecular weight (MW<E T=""52"">Fluorinated GHG) at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver. (C) Maximum flow rate, fluorinated GHG emission rate, concentration, or other relevant parameters specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the process vent. (3) Calculate and sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG in metric tons per year for equipment pieces for each process, E<E T=""52"">ELf, annually. You must include and estimate emissions for types of equipment that are excluded from monitoring, including difficult-to-monitor, unsafe-to-monitor and insulated pieces of equipment, pieces of equipment in heavy liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment where leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device. (g) Emissions from venting of residual fluorinated GHGs in containers. If you vent residual fluorinated GHGs from containers, you must either measure the residual fluorinated GHGs vented from each container or develop a heel factor for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type that you vent. You do not need to estimate de minimis emissions associated with good-faith attempts to recycle or recover residual fluorinated GHGs in or from containers. (1) Measuring contents of each container. If you weigh or otherwise measure the contents of each container before venting the residual fluorinated GHGs, use Equation L–32 of this section to calculate annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG from venting of residual fluorinated GHG from containers. Convert pressures to masses as directed in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. (i) Sample size. For each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type that you vent, select a representative sample of containers that reflects the full range of quantities of residual gas returned in that container size and type. This sample must reflect the full range of the industries and a broad range of the customers that use and return the fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type. The minimum sample size for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type must be 30, unless this is greater than the number of containers returned within that combination annually, in which case the contents of every container returned must be measured. (iv) Calculate annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG from venting of residual fluorinated GHG from containers using Equation L–34 of this section. (7) Subsequent measurements. If a continuous process vent with fluorinated GHG emissions less than 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e, per § 98.123(c)(2), is later found to have fluorinated GHG emissions of 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or greater, you must conduct the emissions testing for the process vent during the following year and develop the process-vent-specific emission factor from the emissions testing. (k) Monitoring for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers. Measure the residual fluorinated GHG in containers received by the facility either using scales or using pressure and temperature measurements. You may use pressure and temperature measurements only in cases where no liquid fluorinated GHG is present in the container. Scales must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent or better of the filled weight (gas plus tare) of the containers of fluorinated GHGs that are typically weighed on the scale. For example, for scales that are generally used to weigh cylinders that contain 115 pounds of gas when full and that have a tare weight of 115 pounds, this equates to ±1 percent of 230 pounds, or ±2.3 pounds. Pressure gauges and thermometers used to measure quantities that are monitored under this paragraph must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent of full scale or better. (3) For each fluorinated GHG group, the total GWP-weighted mass of all fluorinated GHGs in that group emitted from all process vents combined, in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e.

(13) If applicable, the number of containers of size and type j returned to the fluorinated gas production facility, N<E T=""52"">fj, (Equation L–34). (g) The mass of HFC–23 sent off site for destruction shall be measured at least weekly (when being packaged) using flowmeters, weigh scales, or a combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and precision of 1.0 percent of full scale or better. If the measured mass includes more than trace concentrations of materials other than HFC–23, the concentration of the fluorinated GHG shall be measured at least weekly using equipment and methods (e.g., gas chromatography) with an accuracy and precision of 5 percent or better at the concentrations of the process samples. This concentration (mass fraction) shall be multiplied by the mass measurement to obtain the mass of the HFC–23 sent to another facility for destruction.

(f) Well venting for liquids unloadings. Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading using one of the calculation methods described in paragraphs (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions using the method described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. (1) Calculation Method 1. Calculate emissions from wells with plunger lifts and wells without plunger lifts separately. For at least one well of each unique well tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in each sub-basin category (see § 98.238 for the definitions of tubing diameter group, pressure group, and sub-basin category), where gas wells are vented to the atmosphere to expel liquids accumulated in the tubing, install a recording flow meter on the vent line used to vent gas from the well (e.g., on the vent line off the wellhead separator or atmospheric storage tank) according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b). Calculate the total emissions from well venting to the atmosphere for liquids unloading using Equation W–7A of this section. For any tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in a sub-basin where liquids unloading occurs both with and without plunger lifts, Equation W–7A will be used twice, once for wells with plunger lifts and once for wells without plunger lifts. (i) Determine the well vent average flow rate (“FR” in Equation W–7A of this section) as specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section for at least one well in a unique well tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in each sub-basin category.

Calculate the total emissions for each sub-basin from well venting to the atmosphere for liquids unloading with plunger lift assist using Equation W–9 of this section. (g) Well venting during completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing. Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing using Equation W–10A or Equation W–10B of this section. Equation W–10A applies to well venting when the gas flowback rate is measured from a specified number of example completions or workovers and Equation W–10B applies when the gas flowback vent or flare volume is measured for each completion or workover. Completion and workover activities are separated into two periods, an initial period when flowback is routed to open pits or tanks and a subsequent period when gas content is sufficient to route the flowback to a separator or when the gas content is sufficient to allow measurement by the devices specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, regardless of whether a separator is actually utilized. If you elect to use Equation W–10A, you must follow the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(1). If you elect to use Equation W–10B, you must use a recording flow meter installed on the vent line, downstream of a separator and ahead of a flare or vent, to measure the gas flowback. For either equation, emissions must be calculated separately for completions and workovers, for each sub-basin, and for each well type combination identified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. You must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions as specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. If emissions from well venting during completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section. (v) For Equation W–10A of this section, the ratio of gas flowback rate during well completions and workovers from hydraulic fracturing to 30-day gas production rate are applied to all well completions and well workovers, respectively, in the sub-basin and well type combination for the total number of hours of flowback and for the first 30 day average gas production rate for each of these wells. (ii) With flaring or without flaring. (4) Calculate annual emissions from well venting during well completions and workovers from hydraulic fracturing where all or a portion of the gas is flared as specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. (i) Use the volumetric total natural gas emissions vented to the atmosphere during well completions and workovers as determined in paragraph (g) of this section to calculate volumetric and mass emissions using paragraphs (u) and (v) of this section. (ii) Use the calculation method of flare stacks in paragraph (n) of this section to adjust emissions for the portion of gas flared during well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing. This adjustment to emissions from completions using flaring, versus completions without flaring, accounts for the conversion of CH<E T=""52"">4 to CO<E T=""52"">2 in the flare and for the formation on N<E T=""52"">2O during flaring. (h) Gas well venting during completions and workovers without hydraulic fracturing. Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from each gas well venting during workovers without hydraulic fracturing using Equation W–13A of this section. Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from each gas well venting during completions without hydraulic fracturing using Equation W–13B of this section. You must convert annual volumetric natural gas emissions to CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions as specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If emissions from gas well venting during completions and workovers without hydraulic fracturing are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. (2) Calculate annual emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O from gas well venting to flares during well completions and workovers not involving hydraulic fracturing as specified in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. (i) Use the gas well venting volume and gas composition during well completions and workovers that are flared as determined using the methods specified in paragraphs (h) and (h)(1) of this section. (ii) Use the calculation method of flare stacks in paragraph (n) of this section to determine emissions from the flare for gas well venting to a flare during completions and workovers without hydraulic fracturing. (i) Calculate the total annual natural gas emissions from each unique physical volume that is blown down using either Equation W–14A or W–14B of this section. (ii) Except as allowed in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions from each unique physical volume that is blown down by using the annual natural gas emission value as calculated in either Equation W–14A or Equation W–14B of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and the calculation method specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. Calculate the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions for each equipment or event type by summing the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment or event type. (iii) For onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities and LNG import and export equipment, as an alternative to using the procedures in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section, you may elect to sum the annual natural gas emissions as calculated using either Equation W–14A or Equation W–14B of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment type or event type. Calculate the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions for each equipment type or event type using the sums of the total annual natural gas emissions for each equipment type and the calculation method specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. (3) Method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks using a flow meter. In lieu of determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks as specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, you may use a flow meter and measure blowdown vent stack emissions for any unique physical volumes determined according to paragraph (i)(1) of this section to be greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If you choose to use this method, you must measure the natural gas emissions from the blowdown(s) through the monitored stack(s) using a flow meter according to methods in § 98.234(b), and calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions measured by the meters according to paragraph (i)(4) of this section. (j) Onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks. Calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O (when flared) emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon produced liquids from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities (including stationary liquid storage not owned or operated by the reporter), as specified in this paragraph (j). For gas-liquid separators or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting non-separator equipment (e.g., stabilizers, slug catchers) with annual average daily throughput of oil greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 using Calculation Method 1 or 2 as specified in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section. For wells flowing directly to atmospheric storage tanks without passing through a separator with throughput greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using Calculation Method 2 as specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. For hydrocarbon liquids flowing to gas-liquid separators or non-separator equipment or directly to atmospheric storage tanks with throughput less than 10 barrels per day, use Calculation Method 3 as specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 for separators, you must also calculate emissions that may have occurred due to dump valves not closing properly using the method specified in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a vapor recovery system, you must adjust the emissions downward according to paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. (1) Calculation Method 1. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks. Calculate flashing emissions with a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state, models flashing emissions, and speciates CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that will result when the oil from the separator or non-separator equipment enters an atmospheric pressure storage tank. The following parameters must be determined for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from liquid transferred to tanks: (5) Determine if the storage tank receiving your separator oil is sent to flare(s). (i) Use your separator flash gas volume and gas composition as determined in this section. (ii) Use the calculation method of flare stacks in paragraph (n) of this section to determine storage tank emissions from the flare. (6) If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this sectio","98.232 (d) states that “for onshore natural gas processing, report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the following sources”.  For example, if the compressor stream is 100% propane then the emissions will not include CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions and therefore will not have to be reported under subpart W.  However, if the facility exceeds the 25,000 mtCO2e threshold then the owner or operator must report combustion emissions for this compressor under subpart C.",,,1,"The provided context does not mention anything about compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane.

(b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (2) Year and months covered by the report. (3) Date of submittal. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (vii) The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–6 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2011 until March 31, 2013. The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–7 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2013 until March 31, 2015 (as part of the annual report for reporting year 2014), except as otherwise specified in Table A–7 of this subpart. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (ii) The year and months covered by the report. (iii) Date of submittal. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section, upon request by the owner or operator, the Administrator may provide reasonable extensions of the 45-day period for submission of the revised report or information under paragraphs (h)(1) and (2). If the Administrator receives a request for extension of the 45-day period, by email to an address prescribed by the Administrator prior to the expiration of the 45-day period, the extension request is deemed to be automatically granted for 30 days. The Administrator may grant an additional extension beyond the automatic 30-day extension if the owner or operator submits a request for an additional extension and the request is received by the Administrator prior to the expiration of the automatic 30-day extension, provided the request demonstrates that it is not practicable to submit a revised report or information under paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) within 75 days. The Administrator will approve the extension request if the request demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not practicable to collect and process the data needed to resolve potential reporting errors identified pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) or (2) within 75 days. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (3) Timing of request. (i) The initial notice of intent must be submitted no later than January 1, 2011, or by the end of the approved use of best available monitoring methods extension in 2010, whichever is earlier. The completed extension request must be submitted to the Administrator no later than February 15, 2011. (ii) Any subsequent extensions to the original request must be submitted to the Administrator within 4 weeks of the owner or operator identifying the need to extend the request, but in any event no later than 4 weeks before the date for the planned process equipment or unit shutdown that was provided in the original or most recently approved request. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than January 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be purchased and delivered by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, include supporting documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was ordered, investigation of alternative suppliers and the dates by which alternative vendors promised delivery, backorder notices or unexpected delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery, and the current expected date of delivery. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (1) Each such submission shall include the following certification statement signed by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative: “I am authorized to make this submission on behalf of the owners and operators of the facility or supplier, as applicable, for which the submission is made. I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined, and am familiar with, the statements and information submitted in this document and all its attachments. Based on my inquiry of those individuals with primary responsibility for obtaining the information, I certify that the statements and information are to the best of my knowledge and belief true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false statements and information or omitting required statements and information, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment.” (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (2) In order to delegate his or her own authority, to one or more individuals, to submit an electronic submission to the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the designated representative or alternate designated representative must submit electronically to the Administrator a notice of delegation, in a format prescribed by the Administrator, that includes the following elements: (iii) For each such individual, a list of the type or types of electronic submissions under paragraph (m)(1) of this section for which authority is delegated to him or her. (iv) For each type of electronic submission listed in accordance with paragraph (m)(2)(iii) of this section, the facility or supplier for which the electronic submission may be made. (A) “I agree that any electronic submission to the Administrator that is by an agent identified in this notice of delegation and of a type listed, and for a facility or supplier designated, for such agent in this notice of delegation and that is made when I am a designated representative or alternate designated representative, as applicable, and before this notice of delegation is superseded by another notice of delegation under § 98.4(m)(3) shall be deemed to be an electronic submission certified, signed, and submitted by me.” (4) Any electronic submission covered by the certification in paragraph (m)(2)(v)(A) of this section and made in accordance with a notice of delegation effective under paragraph (m)(3) of this section shall be deemed to be an electronic submission certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or alternate designated representative submitting such notice of delegation. (b) For reporting year 2014 and thereafter, unless a later year is specified in the applicable recordkeeping section, you must enter into verification software specified by the Administrator the data specified in the verification software records provision in each applicable recordkeeping section. For each data element entered into the verification software, if the software produces a warning message for the data value and you elect not to revise the data value, you may provide an explanation in the verification software of why the data value is not being revised. Reporting year means the calendar year during which the GHG data are required to be collected for purposes of the annual GHG report. For example, reporting year 2014 is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the annual report for reporting year 2014 is submitted to EPA on March 31, 2015. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (1) The applicable verification data specified in this paragraph (e) are not required to be kept on file or reported for units that meet any one of the three following conditions: (3) Within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, you shall submit explanations of the following: (4) Within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, you shall submit the verification data and information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(v), and (e)(2)(vii) of this section.

Records retained under § 75.57(h) of this chapter for missing data events satisfy the recordkeeping requirements of § 98.3(g)(4) for those same events. (i) If you received Administrator approval for an alternative method of determining N<E T=""52"">2O emissions in the previous reporting year and your methodology is unchanged, your alternative method is automatically approved for the next reporting year. (ii) You must notify the EPA of your use of a previously approved alternative method in your annual report. (iii) Otherwise, you must submit the request within 45 days following promulgation of this subpart or within the first 30 days of each subsequent reporting year. (c) CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions collected and transferred off site under subpart PP of this part (Suppliers of CO<E T=""52"">2), following the requirements of subpart PP. (iv) Neither the approval process nor the failure to obtain approval for the use of results from previous emissions testing shall abrogate your responsibility to comply with the requirements of this subpart. (6) Neither the validation and approval process nor the failure to validate or obtain approval of an alternative method shall abrogate your responsibility to comply with the requirements of this subpart. (y) If your semiconductor manufacturing facility emits more than 40,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e of GHG emissions, based on your most recently submitted annual report (beginning with the 2015 reporting year) as required in paragraph (c) of this section, from the electronics manufacturing processes subject to reporting under this subpart, you must prepare and submit a triennial (every 3 years) technology assessment report to the Administrator (or an authorized representative) that meets the requirements specified in paragraphs (y)(1) through (6) of this section. Any other semiconductor manufacturing facility may voluntarily submit this report to the Administrator. (1) The first report must be submitted with the annual GHG emissions report that is due no later than March 31, 2017, and subsequent reports must be delivered every 3 years no later than March 31 of the year in which it is due. (3) If, on the basis of the information reported in paragraph (y)(2) of this section, the report indicates that GHG emissions from semiconductor manufacturing may have changed from those represented by the default utilization and by-product formation rates in Tables I–3 or I–4, or the default destruction or removal efficiency values in Table I–16 of this subpart, the report must lay out a data gathering and analysis plan focused on the areas of potential change. The plan must describe the elements in paragraphs (y)(3)(i) and (ii). (4) Multiple semiconductor manufacturing facilities may submit a single consolidated 3-year report as long as the facility identifying information in § 98.3(c)(1) and the certification statement in § 98.3(c)(9) is provided for each facility for which the consolidated report is submitted. (b) Calculate and report under this subpart the annual process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the procedure in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. (b) Mass balance monitoring.

facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (2) Year and months covered by the report. (3) Date of submittal. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (vii) The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–6 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2011 until March 31, 2013. The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–7 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2013 until March 31, 2015 (as part of the annual report for reporting year 2014), except as otherwise specified in Table A–7 of this subpart. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (ii) The year and months covered by the report. (iii) Date of submittal. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section, upon request by the owner or operator, the Administrator may provide reasonable extensions of the 45-day period for submission of the revised report or information under paragraphs (h)(1) and (2). If the Administrator receives a request for extension of the 45-day period, by email to an address prescribed by the Administrator prior to the expiration of the 45-day period, the extension request is deemed to be automatically granted for 30 days. The Administrator may grant an additional extension beyond the automatic 30-day extension if the owner or operator submits a request for an additional extension and the request is received by the Administrator prior to the expiration of the automatic 30-day extension, provided the request demonstrates that it is not practicable to submit a revised report or information under paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) within 75 days. The Administrator will approve the extension request if the request demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not practicable to collect and process the data needed to resolve potential reporting errors identified pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) or (2) within 75 days. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (3) Timing of request. (i) The initial notice of intent must be submitted no later than January 1, 2011, or by the end of the approved use of best available monitoring methods extension in 2010, whichever is earlier. The completed extension request must be submitted to the Administrator no later than February 15, 2011. (ii) Any subsequent extensions to the original request must be submitted to the Administrator within 4 weeks of the owner or operator identifying the need to extend the request, but in any event no later than 4 weeks before the date for the planned process equipment or unit shutdown that was provided in the original or most recently approved request. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than January 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be purchased and delivered by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, include supporting documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was ordered, investigation of alternative suppliers and the dates by which alternative vendors promised delivery, backorder notices or unexpected delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery, and the current expected date of delivery. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (1) Each such submission shall include the following certification statement signed by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative: “I am authorized to make this submission on behalf of the owners and operators of the facility or supplier, as applicable, for which the submission is made. I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined, and am familiar with, the statements and information submitted in this document and all its attachments. Based on my inquiry of those individuals with primary responsibility for obtaining the information, I certify that the statements and information are to the best of my knowledge and belief true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false statements and information or omitting required statements and information, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment.” (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (2) In order to delegate his or her own authority, to one or more individuals, to submit an electronic submission to the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the designated representative or alternate designated representative must submit electronically to the Administrator a notice of delegation, in a format prescribed by the Administrator, that includes the following elements: (iii) For each such individual, a list of the type or types of electronic submissions under paragraph (m)(1) of this section for which authority is delegated to him or her. (iv) For each type of electronic submission listed in accordance with paragraph (m)(2)(iii) of this section, the facility or supplier for which the electronic submission may be made. (A) “I agree that any electronic submission to the Administrator that is by an agent identified in this notice of delegation and of a type listed, and for a facility or supplier designated, for such agent in this notice of delegation and that is made when I am a designated representative or alternate designated representative, as applicable, and before this notice of delegation is superseded by another notice of delegation under § 98.4(m)(3) shall be deemed to be an electronic submission certified, signed, and submitted by me.” (4) Any electronic submission covered by the certification in paragraph (m)(2)(v)(A) of this section and made in accordance with a notice of delegation effective under paragraph (m)(3) of this section shall be deemed to be an electronic submission certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or alternate designated representative submitting such notice of delegation. (b) For reporting year 2014 and thereafter, unless a later year is specified in the applicable recordkeeping section, you must enter into verification software specified by the Administrator the data specified in the verification software records provision in each applicable recordkeeping section. For each data element entered into the verification software, if the software produces a warning message for the data value and you elect not to revise the data value, you may provide an explanation in the verification software of why the data value is not being revised. Reporting year means the calendar year during which the GHG data are required to be collected for purposes of the annual GHG report. For example, reporting year 2014 is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the annual report for reporting year 2014 is submitted to EPA on March 31, 2015. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (1) The applicable verification data specified in this paragraph (e) are not required to be kept on file or reported for units that meet any one of the three following conditions: (3) Within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, you shall submit explanations of the following: (4) Within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, you shall submit the verification data and information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(v), and (e)(2)(vii) of this section.

Records retained under § 75.57(h) of this chapter for missing data events satisfy the recordkeeping requirements of § 98.3(g)(4) for those same events. (i) If you received Administrator approval for an alternative method of determining N<E T=""52"">2O emissions in the previous reporting year and your methodology is unchanged, your alternative method is automatically approved for the next reporting year. (iii) Otherwise, you must submit the request within 45 days following promulgation of this subpart or within the first 30 days of each subsequent reporting year. (c) CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions collected and transferred off site under subpart PP of this part (Suppliers of CO<E T=""52"">2), following the requirements of subpart PP. (iv) Neither the approval process nor the failure to obtain approval for the use of results from previous emissions testing shall abrogate your responsibility to comply with the requirements of this subpart. (6) Neither the validation and approval process nor the failure to validate or obtain approval of an alternative method shall abrogate your responsibility to comply with the requirements of this subpart. (y) If your semiconductor manufacturing facility emits more than 40,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e of GHG emissions, based on your most recently submitted annual report (beginning with the 2015 reporting year) as required in paragraph (c) of this section, from the electronics manufacturing processes subject to reporting under this subpart, you must prepare and submit a triennial (every 3 years) technology assessment report to the Administrator (or an authorized representative) that meets the requirements specified in paragraphs (y)(1) through (6) of this section. Any other semiconductor manufacturing facility may voluntarily submit this report to the Administrator. (1) The first report must be submitted with the annual GHG emissions report that is due no later than March 31, 2017, and subsequent reports must be delivered every 3 years no later than March 31 of the year in which it is due. (3) If, on the basis of the information reported in paragraph (y)(2) of this section, the report indicates that GHG emissions from semiconductor manufacturing may have changed from those represented by the default utilization and by-product formation rates in Tables I–3 or I–4, or the default destruction or removal efficiency values in Table I–16 of this subpart, the report must lay out a data gathering and analysis plan focused on the areas of potential change. The plan must describe the elements in paragraphs (y)(3)(i) and (ii). (4) Multiple semiconductor manufacturing facilities may submit a single consolidated 3-year report as long as the facility identifying information in § 98.3(c)(1) and the certification statement in § 98.3(c)(9) is provided for each facility for which the consolidated report is submitted. (b) Calculate and report under this subpart the annual process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the procedure in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, as applicable: (b) Mass balance monitoring.

37,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"The document establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for certain facilities and suppliers, with specific thresholds for emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources and other source categories. It outlines the calculation methods for comparing GHG quantities to the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products. The document also specifies reporting deadlines and requirements for designated representatives, as well as referencing various industry standards and methods for monitoring and reporting GHG emissions. Additionally, it provides guidance on calculating emissions for different types of fuels and the use of alternative reporting options for certain types of combustion units. The document mentioned several calculation methods which explains how to derive the emission from the data. The tables provided in the document offer default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission. These tables include emission factors for different components and equipment types, categorized by region and survey methods. The document also references the EPA's Natural Gas STAR program indirectly by providing guidance on monitoring and reporting GHG emissions, which aligns with the program's objectives of reducing methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sectors through the implementation of cost-effective technologies and practices. Therefore, the final rule relates to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program through its focus on monitoring and reporting GHG emissions and providing guidance on reducing emissions from natural gas production and transmission facilities.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W).

(i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (5) A written GHG Monitoring Plan. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part.

You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). (i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (A) At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if necessary) Method 4 in appendices A–2 and A–3 to part 60 of this chapter to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 3A tests are required, to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration. A Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate (e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded during the test. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (E) The installed CEMS include a gas monitor of any kind or a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, or both and the monitors have been certified, either in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (F) The installed gas or stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors are required, either by an applicable Federal or State regulation or by the unit's operating permit, to undergo periodic quality assurance testing in accordance with either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation. (i) Use Equation C–8a to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms. (ii) Use Equation C–8b to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu. (A) For units in the Acid Rain Program and other units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, obtain (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each type of fuel from the electronic data reports required under § 75.64 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(B) and (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section. (D) Units in the Acid Rain Program and other units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter may use the best available information described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each fuel type, whenever fuel-specific heat input values cannot be directly obtained from the electronic data reports under § 75.64 of this chapter. (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (B) You may use an appropriate flow meter calibration method published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such a method exists. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA, 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (4) You must use one of the following appropriate fuel sampling and analysis methods. The results of chromatographic analysis of the fuel may be used, provided that the gas chromatograph is operated, maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, you may use a method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists, or you may use industry standard practice to determine the carbon content and molecular weight (for gaseous fuel) of the fuel. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA, 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). The method(s) used shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (i) Are subject to the Acid Rain Program. (iii) Are not in the Acid Rain Program, but are required to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and heat input data year-round, in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. (4) Annual natural gas usage (therms/year) (Equation C–1a of § 98.33). (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). (a) The electricity generation source category comprises electricity generating units that are subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program and any other electricity generating units that are required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75. (a) For each electricity generating unit that is subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program or is otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under this subpart the annual mass emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CH<E T=""52"">4 by following the requirements of this subpart. (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. Follow the applicable quality assurance procedures for CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in appendices B, D, and G to 40 CFR part 75. (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (ii) You must notify the EPA of your use of a previously approved alternative method in your annual report. (i) You must determine the amount of process N<E T=""52"">2O emissions that is sold or transferred off site (if applicable). You can determine the amount using existing process flow meters and N<E T=""52"">2O analyzers. (1) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (3) If you manufacture PVs, you must calculate annual production process emissions of each input gas i for threshold applicability purposes using gas-appropriate GWP values shown in Table A–1 to subpart A of this part and Equation I–3 of this subpart. (6) All fluorinated GHGs and N<E T=""52"">2O consumed. (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account for the anticipated change in your preliminary estimate. You may account for such a change using a quantifiable metric (e.g., the ratio of the number of tools that are expected to be vented to the stack system in the current year as compared to the previous reporting year, ratio of the expected number of wafer starts in the current reporting year as compared to the previous reporting year), engineering judgment, or other industry standard practice. (i) The sum of annual emissions of fluorinated GHGs from all of the combined stack systems that are not tested in the fab must be less than 10,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. (iii) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG input gas consumed (in kg of fluorinated GHG emitted per kg of input gas i consumed) in the tools that vent to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–19 of this subpart. If the emissions of input gas i exceed the consumption of input gas i during the sampling period, then equate “E<E T=""52"">is” to the consumption of input gas i and treat the difference between the emissions and consumption of input gas i as a by-product of the other input gases, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (1) You must demonstrate that the fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O apportioning factors are developed using calculations that are repeatable, as defined in § 98.98. (3) As an alternative to developing apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption using a fab-specific engineering model, you may develop apportioning factors through the use of direct measurement using gas flow meters and weigh scales to measure process sub-type, process type, stack system, or fab-specific input gas consumption. You may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a fab-specific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5).

If you elect to calculate fluorinated GHG emissions using the stack test method under § 98.93(i), you must also certify that you have included and accounted for all abatement systems designed for fluorinated GHG abatement and any respective downtime in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(i)(3). (iv) If a measured destruction or removal efficiency is below the manufacturer-claimed fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O destruction or removal efficiency for any abatement system specifically designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement and the abatement system is installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the site maintenance plan for abatement systems that is developed and maintained in your records as specified in § 98.97(d)(9), the measured destruction or removal efficiency must be included in the calculation of the destruction or removal efficiency value for that gas and process sub-type or process type. (h) You must adhere to the QA/QC procedures of this paragraph (h) when calculating annual gas consumption for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O used at each fab and emissions from the use of each fluorinated heat transfer fluid on a fab basis. (iv) Although all applicable stack systems are not required to be tested simultaneously, you must certify that no significant changes in stack flow configuration occur between tests conducted for any particular fab in a reporting year. You must certify that no more than 10 percent of the total number of fluorinated GHG emitting process tools are connected or disconnected from a stack system during testing. You must also certify that no process tools that were in operation at the start of the test period have been moved to a different stack system during the test period (i.e., during or in between testing of individual stack systems) and that no point-of-use abatement systems have been permanently removed from service during the test period. You must document any changes in stack flow configuration in the emissions test data and report required to be kept as records under § 98.97(i)(4). (B) The relative standard deviation for all single fluorinated GHGs that individually accounted for 5 percent or more of CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions were less than 20 percent. (i) Annual consumption of a fluorinated GHG used during the most recent emissions test (expressed in CO<E T=""52"">2e) changes by more than 10 percent of the total annual fluorinated GHG consumption, relative to gas consumption in CO<E T=""52"">2e for that gas during the year of the most recent emissions test (for example, if the use of a single gas goes from 25 percent of CO<E T=""52"">2e to greater than 35 percent of CO<E T=""52"">2e, this change would trigger a re-test). (i) Notify the Administrator (or an authorized representative) of your intention to use an alternative method. You must include in the notification a site-specific test plan describing the alternative method and procedures (the alternative test plan), the range of test conditions over which the validation is intended to be applicable, and an alternative means of calculating the fab-level fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O emissions or determining the abatement system destruction or removal efficiency if the Administrator denies the use of the results of the alternative method under paragraph (k)(2) or (3) of this section.

38,Could EPA clarify that the natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emissions from the data. It specifies the calculation methodologies for CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorinated GHGs, and provides equations for calculating the emissions. The equation describes E = COUNT * EF, where E represents the annual CO2e emissions, COUNT represents the number of units, and EF represents the emission factor. The extraction explains that COUNT is the number of units and EF is the emission factor. Additionally, specific tables such as Table W-5A and Table W-5B provide detailed emission factors for various components in natural gas distribution and population emission factors for distribution mains and distribution services, which are relevant for understanding how the calculation utility accounts for population count and emission factors when providing the user with a final CO2e number.","(2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart.

You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section.

Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d).

(i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions.

If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points.

For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results.

39,"What is the definition of ""facility"" for underground storage?","To determine the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, several key factors need to be considered. These include the emissions of 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year from stationary fuel combustion units, the aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility being 30 mmBtu/hr or greater, and the calculation of annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions using specified methodologies. Additionally, the document outlines conditions under which an owner or operator may discontinue complying with the reporting requirements if reported emissions are consistently below certain thresholds for consecutive years. Furthermore, the document provides several tables such as Table W-1A, Table W-1B, Table W-1C, Table W-1D, Table W-1E, Table W-2, Table W-3A, Table W-3B, Table W-4A, and Table W-4B, which offer default emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and storage. These tables provide valuable data for calculating emissions and determining applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (v) Indicate (yes or no) whether reported emissions include emissions from a cogeneration unit located at the facility. (viii) Applicable source categories means stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all of the source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart present at the facility. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (A) Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units). (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (13) An indication of whether the facility includes one or more plant sites that have been assigned a “plant code” (as defined under § 98.6) by either the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration or by the EPA's Clean Air Markets Division. (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process unit shutdown. Include the date of the most recent process unit shutdown, the frequency of shutdowns for this process unit, and the date of the next planned shutdown during which the monitoring equipment can be installed. If there has been a shutdown or if there is a planned process unit shutdown between promulgation of this part and April 1, 2010, include a justification of why the equipment could not be obtained and installed during that shutdown. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (h) Annual GHG report revisions. This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process unit shutdown. Include the date of the most recent process unit shutdown, the frequency of shutdowns for this process unit, and the date of the next planned shutdown during which the monitoring equipment can be installed. If there has been a shutdown or if there is a planned process unit shutdown between November 29 of the year during which the change in GWPs is published and April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, include a justification of why the equipment could not be obtained and installed during that shutdown. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Conventional-Winter refers to finished gasoline formulated for use in motor vehicles, the composition and properties of which do not meet the requirements of the reformulated gasoline regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 80.40 or the summer RVP standards required under 40 CFR 80.27 or as specified by the state. <E T=""04"">Note: This category excludes conventional blendstock for oxygenate blending (CBOB) as well as other blendstock. Destruction device, for the purposes of subparts II and TT of this part, means a flare, thermal oxidizer, boiler, turbine, internal combustion engine, or any other combustion unit used to destroy or oxidize methane contained in landfill gas or wastewater biogas. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Maximum rated input capacity means the maximum charging rate of a municipal waste combustor unit expressed in tons per day of municipal solid waste combusted, calculated according to the procedures under 40 CFR 60.58b(j). Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. (2) The equipment or a replacement resides at the same location for more than 12 consecutive months. (3) The equipment is located at a seasonal facility and operates during the full annual operating period of the seasonal facility, remains at the facility for at least two years, and operates at that facility for at least three months each year. Primary fuel means the fuel that provides the greatest percentage of the annual heat input to a stationary fuel combustion unit. Working capacity, for the purposes of subpart TT of this part, means the maximum volume or mass of waste that is actually placed in the landfill from an individual or representative type of container (such as a tank, truck, or roll-off bin) used to convey wastes to the landfill, taking into account that the container may not be able to be 100 percent filled and/or 100 percent emptied for each load.

(a) Stationary","A “facility”, as defined in 40 CFR 98.6, must determine if it contains any of the industry segments listed in subpart W and compare its emissions against the 25,000 mtCO2e threshold defined in 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2) to determine applicability.  Underground natural gas storage is as defined in §98.230(a)(5) and includes reporting of GHGs as listed in §98.232(f)(1) through (5).  Therefore, the reporter needs to determine all applicable sources as per this industry segment definition and sources to report.  Specifically, filters and separators are not listed as sources under 98.232(f)(1) through (5) but if filters or separators are associated with any sources under this section, reporting of those listed sources is still required.  The sources required to report under the underground storage source category are listedin §98.232(f).  In this list dehydration units are not included therefore reporting from this source type is not required.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by discussing the applicability of Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources and the factors that need to be considered to determine their emissions. However, it does not directly define 'facility' for underground storage as requested in the question.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate definition of 'facility' for underground storage, including the key factors to consider for determining applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources. It also mentions the tables that provide valuable data for calculating emissions and determining applicability.",1,0.2032786885,4,"The answer does not provide a clear definition of 'facility' for underground storage and suggests considering several factors for determining applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources. The answer does not attempt to answer the question and suggests referring to several tables for data. Hence, the answer conveys uncertainty and makes no attempt to answer the question.",5,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive definition of the term 'facility' for underground storage, including the key factors to consider for determining applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources. The answer also mentions the availability of tables with default emission factors and population emission factors for various equipment and services, which further enhances the coherence of the answer.",1266,,
40,Does Subpart W require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility or does reporting start only when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage?,"The final rule amending 40 CFR Part 98 applies to both onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production. It requires owners and operators of facilities and suppliers subject to this part to follow the requirements, including reporting annual GHG emissions. The rule also specifies conditions under which an owner or operator may discontinue complying with the reporting requirements based on the level of reported emissions over consecutive years. Additionally, the rule outlines specific monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for different subparts related to petroleum and natural gas systems, industrial wastewater treatment, and other source categories. It also provides guidance on calculation methodology, operational changes, and reporting procedures for facilities and suppliers subject to the rule.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (j) Table A–2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (viii) Applicable source categories means stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all of the source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart present at the facility. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (13) An indication of whether the facility includes one or more plant sites that have been assigned a “plant code” (as defined under § 98.6) by either the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration or by the EPA's Clean Air Markets Division. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (ii) “I certify that I have all the necessary authority to carry out my duties and responsibilities under 40 CFR part 98 on behalf of the owners and operators of the facility or supplier, as applicable, and that each such owner and operator shall be fully bound by my representations, actions, inactions, or submissions.” (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (iv) Petroleum products that are received or produced at a refinery and subsequently injected into a crude supply or reservoir by the same refinery owner or operator. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Operational change means, for purposes of § 98.3(b), a change in the type of feedstock or fuel used, a change in operating hours, or a change in process production rate. Petroleum means oil removed from the earth and the oil derived from tar sands and shale. Petroleum product means all refined and semi-refined products that are produced at a refinery by processing crude oil and other petroleum-based feedstocks, including petroleum products derived from co-processing biomass and petroleum feedstock together, but not including plastics or plastic products. Petroleum products may be combusted for energy use, or they may be used either for non-energy processes or as non-energy products. The definition of petroleum product for importers and exporters excludes waxes. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98. The materials listed in this section are incorporated by reference in the corresponding sections noted.

(1) Oil and Gas Field Code Master List 2008, DOE/EIA0370(08), January 2009, IBR approved for § 98.238. Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. (1) Portable equipment, as defined in § 98.6. (2) Emergency generators and emergency equipment, as defined in § 98.6. (4) Flares, unless otherwise required by provisions of another subpart of this part to use methodologies in this subpart. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (ii) The minimum required sampling frequency for determining the annual average HHV (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or by lot) is specified in § 98.34. The method for computing the annual average HHV is a function of unit size and how frequently you perform or receive from the fuel supplier the results of fuel sampling for HHV. The method is specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) or (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, as applicable. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (iv) May not be used if you routinely perform fuel sampling and analysis for the fuel high heat value (HHV) or routinely receive the results of HHV sampling and analysis from the fuel supplier at the minimum frequency specified in § 98.34(a), or at a greater frequency. In such cases, Tier 2 shall be used. This restriction does not apply to paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(v), (b)(1)(vi), and (b)(1)(vii) of this section. (iii) Shall be used for a fuel not listed in Table C–1 of this subpart if the fuel is combusted in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr (or, pursuant to § 98.36(c)(3), in a group of units served by a common supply pipe, having at least one unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr), provided that both of the following conditions apply: (iii) No later than 180 days following the date on which a change is made that triggers Tier 4 applicability under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii) of this section (e.g., a change in the primary fuel, manner of unit operation, or installed continuous monitoring equipment). (4) Use Equation C–10 of this section for: units subject to subpart D of this part; units that qualify for and elect to use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methodologies described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section; and units that use the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. (C) For Tier 4 units, use the best available information (e.g., fuel feed rate measurements, fuel heating values, engineering analysis) to estimate the value of (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each type of fuel. Instrumentation used to make these estimates is not subject to the calibration requirements of § 98.3(i) or to the QA requirements of § 98.34. (1) You may use Equation C–1 of this subpart to calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the combustion of the biomass fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (except MSW and tires), in a unit of any size, including units equipped with a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS, except when the use of Tier 2 is required as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. Determine the quantity of biomass combusted using one of the following procedures in this paragraph (e)(1), as appropriate, and document the selected procedures in the Monitoring Plan under § 98.3(g): (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). (ii) Determine the relative proportions of biogenic and non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in the flue gas on a quarterly basis using the method specified in § 98.34(d) (for units that combust MSW as the primary fuel or as t",Under 98.230(a)(5) reporting is only required for “…salt dome caverns that store natural gas…” Methane emissions from building of a storage facility are not included in the reporting for subpart W.  Emissions reporting is required when the storage facility is operational.,,,1,The answer does not provide a clear and direct answer to the question about reporting requirements for emissions during the salt dome mining process.

41,Are dehydration units that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility?,"The text defines offshore as seaward of the terrestrial borders of the United States, including waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, as well as adjacent bays, lakes, or other normally standing waters. This definition implies that sites in south Louisiana located within the State boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous (not in Federal waters but subject to the ebb and flow of the tide) would be considered offshore, as they are seaward of the terrestrial border and are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide.","Offshore means seaward of the terrestrial borders of the United States, including waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, as well as adjacent bays, lakes or other normally standing waters, and extending to the outer boundaries of the jurisdiction and control of the United States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. ","The sources required to report under the underground storage source category are listed in 98.232(f).  Dehydration units are not included.  Therefore, reporting from this source type is not required.",2,"The answer does not address the main aspect of the question, which is about dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage.

42,Do I have to calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emissions from the data. It outlines the reporting requirements for owners and operators of facilities and suppliers, including the calculation methodologies for quantifying and reporting emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources. It also provides details on monitoring methods, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, as well as the use of best available monitoring methods in specific scenarios. Additionally, it includes tables such as Default Whole Gas Emission Factors, Default Average Component Counts, Designation Of Eastern And Western U.S., Default Whole Gas Leaker Emission Factors, and Default Total Hydrocarbon Emission Factors, which provide specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services in the Eastern and Western U.S. The document does not specifically mention BOEMRE's GOADS instructions, but it does provide comprehensive information on quantifying and reporting emissions from stationary sources of fuel combustion in accordance with the methodologies specified in 40 CFR Part 98 Subpart C.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (j) Table A–2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (i) Electronics Manufacturing (subpart I). (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iii) Magnesium Production (subpart T). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (ix) Manufacture of Electric Transmission and Distribution (subpart SS). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (xi) Injection of Carbon Dioxide (subpart UU). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (viii) Applicable source categories means stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all of the source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart present at the facility. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (13) An indication of whether the facility includes one or more plant sites that have been assigned a “plant code” (as defined under § 98.6) by either the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration or by the EPA's Clean Air Markets Division. (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (B) Identification of the specific rule requirements (by rule subpart, section, and paragraph numbers) for which the instrumentation is needed. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (B) Identification of the specific rule requirements (by rule subpart, section, and paragraph numbers) for which the instrumentation is needed. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (a) General.

(iii) No later than 180 days following the date on which a change is made that triggers Tier 4 applicability under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii) of this section (e.g., a change in the primary fuel, manner of unit operation, or installed continuous monitoring equipment). (4) Use Equation C–10 of this section for: units subject to subpart D of this part; units that qualify for and elect to use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methodologies described in paragra","To answer the second question about pressure relief valves, Sections 98.233(q)(6) and (7) state that emission factors for “…equipment leaks detected from valves, pump seals, connectors, and other” shall be used from Tables W-5 and W-6 in the rule. A pressure relief valve is a special type of valve and falls in the category of ""other,"" so this emission source is included in the leak detection survey and required to be reported.  Regarding your first question: sections 98.232(g) and 98.232(h) do no include venting from LNG storage tanks as an emission source; therefore venting emissions from LNG storage tank are not required for LNG storage or for LNG import and export equipment.  However, if the LNG storge tank is blown down to atmosphere, then section 98.232(h) does require reporting.",,,,,1,0.2222222222,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,,,1140,,
43,"How are we to treat GHG reporting applicability offshore LNG where the offshore terminal is basically buoy out in the ocean where a ship connects, regasifies the LNG onboard and injects natural gas under pressure into the pipeline?","The given input contains a mix of information related to greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements, emission factors, and tables outlining default emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities. However, it does not directly address the specific question about offshore facilities and the reporting of GHG emissions for RY2011. Further clarification or filtering of the input is needed to provide a more accurate extraction and explanation of the relevant regulations and requirements for offshore facilities.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. For these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the subparts listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (1) Calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is imported and the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is exported during the year. (2) Convert the mass of each imported and each GHG exported from paragraph (f)(1) of this section to metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (c) Content of the annual report.

(v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010. Upon request by the Administrator, the records required under this section must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper documents.

(1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (3) A substantive error is an error that impacts the quantity of GHG emissions reported or otherwise prevents the reported data from being validated or verified. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data from each measurement device shall be documented in the written monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You must also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (v) Include a description of the proposed best available monitoring method for estimating GHG emissions during the time prior to installation of the meter. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device install","The LNG import and export terminal source category includes offshore equipment that receives imported LNG via ocean transport, stores LNG, re-gasifies LNG, and delivers re-gasified natural gas to a natural gas transmission or distribution system.  The floating vessels described above, not the ships, are considered LNG import terminal facilities.  Applicability would be determined by determining the estimated emissions and comparing against the threshold in 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2).",1,"The answer does not address the question about GHG reporting applicability for offshore LNG facilities.

This will involve identifying the relevant equations and their explanations, and discarding the rest of the input.'}","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part.

The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions.

(E) Each fluorinated GHG (including those not listed in Table A–1 of this subpart). (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (C) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be obtained and installed before April 1, 2010. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 means carbon dioxide emissions generated as the result of biomass combustion from combustion units for which emission calculations are required by an applicable part 98 subpart. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Carbon dioxide stream means carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source (e.g. a power plant or other industrial facility) or extracted from a carbon dioxide production well plus incidental associated substances either derived from the source materials and the capture process or extracted with the carbon dioxide. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Global warming potential or GWP means the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of one kilogram of a trace substance relative to that of one kilogram of a reference gas (i.e., CO<E T=""52"">2). GWPs for each greenhouse gas are provided in Table A–1 of this subpart. For purposes of the calculations in this part, if the GHG has a chemical-specific GWP listed in Table A–1, use that GWP. Otherwise, use the default GWP provided in Table A–1 for the fluorinated GHG group of which the GHG is a member. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. (36) ASTM D7459–08 Standard Practice for Collection of Integrated Samples for the Speciation of Biomass (Biogenic) and Fossil-Derived Carbon Dioxide Emitted from Stationary Emissions Sources, IBR approved for § 98.34(d), § 98.34(e), and § 98.36(e). (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (i) Equation C–2a of this section applies to any type of fuel listed in Table C–1 of the subpart, except for municipal solid waste (MSW). For MSW combustion, use Equation C–2c of this section. (iii) For units that combust municipal solid waste (MSW) and that produce steam, use Equation C–2c of this section. Equation C–2c of this section may also be used for any other solid fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart provided that steam is generated by the unit. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (v) Each hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack. (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (B) Calculate a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate (in metric tons/hr) from the stack test data, using a version of Equation C–6 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, modified as follows. In the Equation C–6 nomenclature, replace the words “Hourly average” in the definitions of “C<E T=""52"">CO2” and “Q” with the words “3-run average”. Substitute the arithmetic average values of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate from the emission testing into modified Equation C–6. If CO<E T=""52"">2 is measured on a dry basis, a moisture correction of the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate is required. Use Equation C–7 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section to make this correction; replace the word “Hourly” with the words “3-run average” in the equation nomenclature. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (G) Finally, add the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the unit. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Use the hourly heat input data from appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, together with Equation G–4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates, in units of tons/hr; (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons; and (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons, using Equation LM–11 in § 75.19(c)(4)(iii) of this chapter. (B) Sum the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions values over the entire reporting year to obtain the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (A) Use Equation F–11 or F–2 (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates from the CEMS data. If an O<E T=""52"">2 monitor is used, convert the hourly average O<E T=""52"">2 readings to CO<E T=""52"">2 using Equation F–14a or F–14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (as applicable), before applying Equation F–11 or F–2. (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (iv) For units that qualify to use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methods in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(iii) of this section, if both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, separate calculation and reporting of the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) is optional, only for the 2010 reporting year, as provided in § 98.3(c)(12). (b) Use of the four tiers. Use of the four tiers of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methodologies desc",LNG storage vessels are considered above ground if any portion of the vessel is above grade.,,,1,"The given context and answer are not relevant to the question about whether an LNG storage vessel is considered 'above ground' if any portion of the vessel is above grade.

It also outlines reporting requirements and deadlines for different reporting years, including 2010 and 2011. The data from 2011 BOEMRE can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility, as it falls within the scope of the reporting requirements outlined in the document. Additionally, the document contains several tables providing detailed information on emission factors, component counts, and designations for different regions and equipment types in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, crude oil production equipment, and natural gas processing plants.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources.

Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more.

The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (3) The annual GHG reports. (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (iv) Petroleum products that are received or produced at a refinery and subsequently injected into a crude supply or reservoir by the same refinery owner or operator. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Petroleum product means all refined and semi-refined products that are produced at a refinery by processing crude oil and other petroleum-based feedstocks, including petroleum products derived from co-processing biomass and petroleum feedstock together, but not including plastics or plastic products. Petroleum products may be combusted for energy use, or they may be used either for non-energy processes or as non-energy products. The definition of petroleum product for importers and exporters excludes waxes. Reporting year means the calendar year during which the GHG data are required to be collected for purposes of the annual GHG report. For example, reporting year 2014 is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the annual report for reporting year 2014 is submitted to EPA on March 31, 2015. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wellhead means the piping, casing, tubing and connected valves protruding above the earth's surface for an oil and/or natural gas well. The wellhead ends where the flow line connects to a wellhead valve. Wellhead equipment includes all equipment, permanent and portable, located on the improved land area (i.e. well pad) surrounding one or multiple wellheads.

(4) Emissions Inventory Improvement Program, Volume II: Chapter 16, Methods for Estimating Air Emissions from Chemical Manufacturing Facilities, August 2007, Final, http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/eiip/techreport/volume02/index.html, IBR approved for § 98.123(c)(1)(i)(A). You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (C) The results of each annual stack test shall be used in the GHG emissions calculations for the year of the test. (G) Finally, add the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the unit. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons, using Equation LM–11 in § 75.19(c)(4)(iii) of this chapter. (B) Sum the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions values over the entire reporting year to obtain the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (iv) For units that qualify to use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methods in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(iii) of this section, if both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, separate calculation and reporting of the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) is optional, only for the 2010 reporting year, as provided in § 98.3(c)(12). (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (ii) No later than January 1, 2011, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on January 1, 2010, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have not been installed and certified by January 1, 2010. In this case, you may use Tier 2 or Tier 3 to report GHG emissions for 2010. However, if the required CEMS are certified some time in 2010, you need not wait until January 1, 2011 to begin using Tier 4. Rather, you may switch from Tier 2 or Tier 3 to Tier 4 as soon as CEMS certification testing is successfully completed. If this reporting option is chosen, you must document the change in CO<E T=""52"">2 calculation methodology in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5) and in the GHG emissions report under § 98.3(c). Data recorded by the CEMS during a certification test period in 2010 may be used for reporting under this part, provided that the following two conditions are met: (c) Calculation of CH<E T=""54"">4 and N<E T=""54"">2O emissions from stationary combustion sources. You must calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions only for units that are required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the calculation methodologies of this subpart and for only those fuels that are listed in Table C–2 of this subpart. (2) Use Equation C–9a of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 2 Equation C–2a of this section to estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions. Use the same values for fuel consumption and HHV that you use for the Tier 2 calculation. (i) If only one type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart is combusted during the reporting year, substitute the cumulative annual heat input from combustion of the fuel into Equation C–10 of this section to calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 or N<E T=""52"">2O emissions. For units in the Acid Rain Program and units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, obtain the cumulative annual heat input directly from the electronic data reports required under § 75.64 of this chapter. For Tier 4 units, use the best available information, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate the cumulative annual heat input (HI)<E T=""52"">A. (A) For units in the Acid Rain Program and other units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, obtain (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each type of fuel from the electronic data reports required under § 75.64 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(B) and (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section. (5) When multiple fuels are combusted during the reporting year, sum the fuel-specific results from Equations C–8, C–8a, C–8b, C–9a, C–9b, or C–10 of this section (as applicable) to obtain the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions, in metric tons. (D) Sum the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions across all component fuels to obtain the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions for the blend. Similarly sum the annual N<E T=""52"">2O emissions across all component fuels to obtain the annual N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for the blend. Report these annual emissions totals. (2) The total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions reported for the unit shall include the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion process and the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the sorbent. (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). (ii) Sum all of the hourly V<E T=""52"">CO2h values for the reporting year, to obtain V<E T=""52"">total, the total annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted. (iii) Calculate the annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion using Equation C–13 of this section. If two or more types of fossil fuel are combusted during the year, perform a separate calculation with Equation C–13 of this section for each fuel and sum the results. (C) From the electronic data report required under § 75.64 of this chapter, for units in the Acid Rain Program and other units using CEMS to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions according to part 75 of this chapter. However, before calculating the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, multiply the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by 0.91 to convert from short tons to metric tons. (i) Use an applicable CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation method in this section to quantify the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the unit. (A) Calculate the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from combustion of MSW and/or tires in the unit, using the Tier 1 calculation methodology in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data for stationary fuel combustion sources shall be monitored as follows: (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-rou",Submerged LNG pumps are not covered in subpart W as there are no emissions from this source.,,,1,"The answer provided is not related to the context given. The context is about GHG reporting requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, while the answer talks about treatment of pumps at LNG storage sites, which is not mentioned in the context.",1,0.0597014925,4,"The answer does not address the question and provides irrelevant information about GHG emissions and reporting requirements. It conveys uncertainty by suggesting that the answer may be found in a different source, but does not make any attempt to answer the question.",3,The answer partially addresses the question but lacks coherence in some sentences and does not flow naturally as a whole.,870,,
46,"Are LNG storage sites located adjacent to subpart D facilities under ""common control"" required to report emissions under the subpart D ""facility"" or should the LDC report the emissions under subpart W?","The document mentioned the mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for facilities and suppliers, including the calculation methodologies for emissions. It specifies that facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year from stationary fuel combustion sources must report under subpart C. Additionally, it provides provisions for discontinuing reporting if emissions fall below certain thresholds for consecutive years. The document also details the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting, as well as the verification and recordkeeping requirements. It defines terms such as Outer Continental Shelf and provides references to additional materials available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, the document references several tables such as Table W-1A, Table W-1B, Table W-1C, Table W-1D, Table W-1E, and Table W-2, which provide emission factors, component counts, and designations for different equipment and facilities in the petroleum and natural gas industry. These tables are essential for understanding the emission calculation methodologies and requirements for reporting under subpart C.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (6) A written explanation, as required under § 98.3(e), if you change emission calculation methodologies during the reporting period. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010. Upon request by the Administrator, the records required under this section must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper documents. You must retain the following records, in addition to those records prescribed in each applicable subpart of this part: (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used. For data required by § 98.5(b) to be entered into verification software specified in § 98.5(b), maintain the entered data in the format generated by the verification software according to § 98.5(b). (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (3) The annual GHG reports. (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (iv) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall make all information that is collected in conformance with the GHG Monitoring Plan available for review during an audit. Electronic storage of the information in the plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available in hard copy upon request during an audit. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You must also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than January 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition.

Cogeneration unit means a unit that produces electrical energy and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, or heating or cooling purposes, through the sequential or simultaneous use of the original fuel energy. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Day means any consistently designated 24 hour period during which an emission unit is operated. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Destruction device, for the purposes of subparts II and TT of this part, means a flare, thermal oxidizer, boiler, turbine, internal combustion engine, or any other combustion unit used to destroy or oxidize methane contained in landfill gas or wastewater biogas. Diesel—Other is any distillate fuel oil not defined elsewhere, including Diesel Treated as Blendstock (DTAB). Emergency generator means a stationary combustion device, such as a reciprocating internal combustion engine or turbine that serves solely as a secondary source of mechanical or electrical power whenever the primary energy supply is disrupted or discontinued during power outages or natural disasters that are beyond the control of the owner or operator of a facility. An emergency generator operates only during emergency situations, for training of personnel under simulated emergency conditions, as part of emergency demand response procedures, or for standard performance testing procedures as required by law or by the generator manufacturer. A generator that serves as a back-up power source under conditions of load shedding, peak shaving, power interruptions pursuant to an interruptible power service agreement, or scheduled facility maintenance shall not be considered an emergency generator. Fluid coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced in a fluidized bed system. The fluid coking unit includes equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for heat recovery on the fluid coking burner exhaust vent. There are two basic types of fluid coking units: A traditional fluid coking unit in which only a small portion of the coke produced in the unit is burned to fuel the unit and the fluid coking burner exhaust vent is directed to the atmosphere (after processing in a CO boiler or other air pollutant control equipment) and a flexicoking unit in which an auxiliary burner is used to partially combust a significant portion of the produced petroleum coke to generate a low value fuel gas that is used as fuel in other combustion sources at the refinery. Fossil fuel means natural gas, petroleum, coal, or any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material, for purpose of creating useful heat. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Operating hours means the duration of time in which a process or process unit is utilized; this excludes shutdown, maintenance, and standby. (3) The equipment is located at a seasonal facility and operates during the full annual operating period of the seasonal facility, remains at the facility for at least two years, and operates at that facility for at least three months each year. Primary fuel means the fuel that provides the greatest percentage of the annual heat input to a stationary fuel combustion unit. (a) Stationary fuel combustion sources are devices that combust solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, generally for the purposes of producing electricity, generating steam, or providing useful heat or energy for industrial, commercial, or institutional use, or reducing the volume of waste by removing combustible matter. Stationary fuel combustion sources include, but are not limited to, boilers, simple and combined-cycle combustion turbines, engines, incinerators, and process heaters. (3) Irrigation pumps at agricultural operations. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. (v) Each hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) May be used for MSW in a unit of any size that does not produce steam, if the use of Tier 4 is not required. (iii) May be used for solid, gaseous, or liquid biomass fuels in a unit of any size provided that the fuel is listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. (vii) May be used for the combustion of MSW and/or tires in a unit, provided that no more than 10 percent of the unit's annual heat input is derived from those fuels, combined. Notwithstanding this requirement, if a unit combusts both MSW and tires and the reporter elects not to separately calculate and report biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of tires, Tier 1 may be used for the MSW combustion, provided that no more than 10 percent of the unit's annual heat input is derived from MSW. (ii) May be used in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr for the combustion of natural gas and/or distillate fuel oil. (iii) May be used for MSW in a unit of any size that produces steam, if the use of Tier 4 is not required. (B) The fuel provides 10% or more of the annual heat input to the unit or, if § 98.36(c)(3) applies, to the group of units served by a common supply pipe. (i) May be used for a unit of any size, combusting any type of fuel. Tier 4 may also be used for any group of stationary fuel combustion units, process units, or manufacturing units that share a common stack or duct. (B) The unit combusts solid fossil fuel or MSW as the primary fuel. (C) The unit has operated for more than 1,000 hours in any calendar year since 2005. (iii) Shall be used for a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less and for a unit that combusts municipal solid waste with a maximum rated input capacity of 600 tons of MSW per day or less, if the unit meets all of the following three conditions: (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met. (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (iii) No later than 180 days following the date on which a change is made that triggers Tier 4 applicability under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii) of this section (e.g., a change in the primary fuel, manner of unit operation, or installed continuous monitoring equipment). (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (5) When multiple fuels are combusted during the reporting year, sum the fuel-specific results from Equations C–8, C–8a, C–8b, C–9a, C–9b, or C–10 of this section (as applicable) to obtain the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions, in metric tons. (iii) The best available information for premixed fuels that contain biomass and fossil fuels (e.g., liquid fuel mixtures containing biodiesel). (B) The owner or operator shall document in the monitoring plan under § 98.3(g)(5) how the monthly sampling of each type of fuel is performed. (3) Special considerations for blending of fuels. In situations where different types of fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (for example, different ranks of coal or different grades of fuel oil) are in the same state of matter (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas), and are blended prior to combustion, use the following procedures to determine the appropriate CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor and HHV for the blend. (2) The owner or operator shall document in the monitoring plan under § 98.3(g)(5) how the monthly sampling of each type of fuel is performed. (iii) The provisions of an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (2) If an O<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor is used to determine CO<E T=""52"">2 concentrations, the applicable provisions of part 75 of this chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program shall be followed for initial certification and on-going quality assurance, and all required RATAs of the monitor shall be done on a percent CO<E T=""52"">2 basis. (3) For ongoing quality assurance, follow the applicable procedures in either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. If appendix F to part 60 of this chapter is selected for on-going quality assurance, perform daily calibration drift assessments for both the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and the flow rate monitor, conduct cylinder gas audits of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor in three of the four quarters of each year (except for non-operating quarters), and perform annual RATAs of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and the CERMS. (4) For the purposes of this part, the stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor RATAs required by appendix B to part 75 of this chapter and the annual RATAs of the CERMS required by appendix F to part 60 of this chapter need only be done at one operating level, representing normal load or normal process operating conditions, both for initial certification and for ongoing quality assurance. (5) If, for any source operating hour, quality assured data are not obtained with a CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor), flow rate monitor, or (if applicable) moisture monitor, use appropriate substitute data values in accordance with the missing data provisions of § 98.35. (e) For other units that combust combinations of biomass fuel(s) (or heterogeneous fuels that have a biomass component, e.g., tires) and fossil (or other non-biogenic) fuel(s), in any proportions, ASTM D6866–16 and ASTM D7459–08 (both incorporated by reference, see § 98.7) may be used to determine the biogenic portion of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in every calendar quarter in which biomass and non-biogenic fuels are co-fired in the unit. Follow the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section. If the primary fuel for multiple units at the facility consists of tires, and the units are fed from a common fuel source, testing at only one of the units is sufficient. (2) Fuel consumption, when solid fuel is combusted and the Tier 3 Calculation Methodology is used. (3) Fossil fuel consumption when § 98.33(e)(2) applies to a unit that uses CEMS to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions and that combusts both fossil and biomass fuels. (6) Biogenic fuel consumption and high heating value, as applicable, under §§ 98.33(e)(5) and (e)(6). (b) Units that use the four tiers. You shall report the following information for stationary combustion units that use the Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, or Tier 4 methodology in § 98.33(a) to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section: (4) Each type of fuel combusted in the unit during the report year. (iii) An estimate of the heat input from each type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart that was combusted in the unit during the report year. (1) Aggregation of units. If a facility contains two or more units (e.g., boilers or combustion turbines), each of which has a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less, you may report the combined GHG emissions for the group of units in lieu of reporting GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the use of Tier 4 is not required or elected for any of the units and the units use the same tier for any common fuels combusted. If this option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (iv) Each type of fuel combusted in the units during the year. (x) For each type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart that was combusted during the report year in the units sharing the common stack or duct during the report year, the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (iv) The fuels combusted in the units during the reporting year. (vi) If the any of the units burns both fossil fuels and biomass, the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from combustion of all fossil fuels and annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from combustion of all biomass fuels from the units served by the common pipe, expressed in metric tons. (vii) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each fuel type for the units served by the common pipe, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e. (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (ii) On an annual basis, at least 95 percent (by mass or volume) of the shared fuel is combusted in the large combustion unit(s), and the remainder is combusted in the small combustion sources. Company records may be used to determine the percentage distribution of the shared fuel to the large and small units; and (A) Each type of fuel combusted in the unit during the reporting year. (iii) For units with continuous monitoring systems that use the alternative method for units with continuous monitoring systems in § 98.33(a)(5)(iii) to monitor heat input year-round according to part 75 of this chapter: (A) The total number of source operating hours in the reporting year. (f) Each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) subject to reporting under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section must indicate if both of the following two conditions are met: (1) The stationary fuel combustion source contains at least one combustion unit connected to a fuel-fired electric generator owned or operated by an entity that is subject to regulation of customer billing rates by the public utility commission (excluding generators that are connected to combustion units that are subject to subpart D of this part). (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. (c) For each stationary fuel combustion unit that does not generate electricity, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C of this part. (b) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C. (c) Number of facility and unit operating hours in calendar year. (d) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the requirements of subpart C. (b) CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit. You must report these emissions under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), by following the requirements of subpart C, except that for ammonia manufacturing processes subpart C does not apply to any CO<E T=""52"">2 resulting from combustion of the waste recycle stream (commonly referred to as the purge gas stream). (c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (b) CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O combustion emissions from each stationary combustion unit. You must calculate and report these emissions under subpart C of this part (General Stationar","Equipment/component leaks are random in nature and minimal leaks in one year do not guarantee similar leak levels in the future.  There are no sunsetting provisions for individual emissions sources, only facilities.  EPA has provided provisions that allow facilities to stop reporting under certain conditions and with prior notification to EPA.  Please see 40 CFR 98.2(i) (1) – (i) (3).  EPA addressed sunset provisions in general in the proposal to the 2009 Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule (74 FR 16478).",5,The answer is completely irrelevant to the question and does not address any of the main aspects mentioned in the context.,1,"The given input does not provide any information related to the question asked about LDC and custody transfer city gate station.

During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources.

(e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type. These data include but are not limited to the following information in this paragraph (g)(2): (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used.

The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Use the hourly heat input data from appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, together with Equation G–4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates, in units of tons/hr; (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (b) Use of the four tiers. Use of the four tiers of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methodologies described in paragraph (a) of this section is subject to the following conditions, requirements, and restrictions: (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (c) Calculation of CH<E T=""54"">4 and N<E T=""54"">2O emissions from stationary combustion sources. You must calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions only for units that are required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the calculation methodologies of this subpart and for only those fuels that are listed in Table C–2 of this subpart. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation. (2) Use Equation C–9a of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 2 Equation C–2a of this section to estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions. Use the same values for fuel consumption and HHV that you use for the Tier 2 calculation. (5) When multiple fuels are combusted during the reporting year, sum the fuel-specific results from Equations C–8, C–8a, C–8b, C–9a, C–9b, or C–10 of this section (as applicable) to obtain the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions, in metric tons. (2) The total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions reported for the unit shall include the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion process and the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the sorbent. (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). (ii) Sum all of the hourly V<E T=""52"">CO2h values for the reporting year, to obtain V<E T=""52"">total, the total annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted. (C) From the electronic data report required under § 75.64 of this chapter, for units in the Acid Rain Program and other units using CEMS to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions according to part 75 of this chapter. However, before calculating the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, multiply the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by 0.91 to convert from short tons to metric tons. (i) Use an applicable CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation method in this section to quantify the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the unit. (4) If Equation C–1 or Equation C–2a of this section is selected to calculate the annual biogenic mass emissions for wood, wood waste, or other solid biomass-derived fuel, Equation C–15 of this section may be used to quantify biogenic fuel consumption, provided that all of the required input parameters are accurately quantified. Similar equations and calculation methodologies based on steam generation and boiler efficiency may be used, provided that they are documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required by § 98.3(g)(5). (5) For units subject to subpart D of this part and for units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may calculate biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart using Equation C–15a. This equation may not be used to calculate biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of tires or MSW; the methods described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section must be used for those fuels. Whenever (HI)<E T=""52"">A, the annual heat input from combustion of biomass fuel in Equation C–15a, cannot be determined solely from the information in the electronic emissions reports under § 75.64 of this chapter (e.g., in cases where a unit uses CEMS in combination with multiple F-factors, a worst-case F-factor, or a prorated F-factor to report heat input rather than reporting heat input based on fuel type), use the best available information (as described in §§ 98.33(c)(4)(ii)(C) and (c)(4)(ii)(D)) to determine (HI)<E T=""52"">A. The CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data for stationary fuel combustion sources shall be monitored as follows: (iv) If the fuel blend described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section consists of a mixture of fuel(s) listed in Table C–1 of this subpart and one or more fuels not listed in Table C–1, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 and other GHG emissions only for the Table C–1 fuel(s), using the best available estimate of the mass or volume percentage(s) of the Table C–1 fuel(s) in the blend. In this case, Tier 1 shall be used, with the following modifications to Equations C–17 and C–1, to account for the fact that not all of the fuels in the blend are listed in Table C–1: (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (1) For each missing value of the high heating value, carbon content, or molecular weight of the fuel, substitute the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and immediately following the missing data incident. If the “after” value has not been obtained by the time that the GHG emissions report is due, you may use the “before” value for missing data substitution or the best available estimate of the parameter, based on all available process data (e.g., electrical load, steam production, operating hours). If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-assured value obtained after the missing data period. (2) For missing records of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, percent moisture, fuel usage, and sorbent usage, the substitute data value shall be the best available estimate of the parameter, based on all available process data (e.g., electrical load, steam production, operating hours, etc.). You must document and retain records of the procedures used for all such estimates. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (5) The methodology (i.e., tier) used to calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions for each type of fuel combusted (i.e., Tier 1, 2, 3, or 4). (i) The annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (including biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2), and the annual CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions for each type of fuel combusted during the reporting year, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e; and (ii) Metric tons of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions (if applicable). (i) If the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS consists entirely of non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 (i.e., CO<E T=""52"">2 from fossil fuel combustion plus, if applicable, CO<E T=""52"">2 from sorbent and/or process CO<E T=""52"">2), report the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, expressed in metric tons. You are not required to report the combustion CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions by fuel type. (ii) Report the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS. If this total includes both biogenic and non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, separately report the annual non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from biomass combustion, each expressed in metric tons. You are not required to report the combustion CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions by fuel type. (vi) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and annual CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions, aggregated for each type of fuel combusted in the group of units during the report year, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e. If any of the units burn both fossil fuels and biomass, report also the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from combustion of all fossil fuels combined and annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from combustion of all biomass fuels combined, expressed in metric tons. (vii) The methodology (i.e., tier) used to calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel combusted in the units (i.e., Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3).

(iii) Are not in the Acid Rain Program, but are required to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and heat input data year-round, in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. (2) For stationary combustion sources using the Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 Calculation Methodologies in § 98.33(a) to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions, the following additional information shall be kept on file and included in the GHG emissions report, where indicated: (E) For each HHV used in the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculations for each type of fuel combusted during the reporting year, indicate whether the HHV is a measured value or a substitute data value.

The calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts are used to calculate emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources. The emission factors provided in Table W-1A are specific to various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. These factors are used in the calculation methodologies to determine the greenhouse gas emissions from these facilities. The emission factors are expressed in terms of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) and are used in conjunction with the number of units of each component to calculate the total emissions. For leaking components, the calculation would involve multiplying the number of leaking units by the emission factor for each component, as specified in the relevant subparts of the environmental regulations. The specific calculation method for emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources, when monitoring of components is not required, may be outlined in the relevant subparts of the regulations or industry guidelines. It is important to refer to the specific regulations and guidelines to accurately determine the calculation method in such cases.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part.

For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only.

(2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion.

(c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (1) Calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is imported and the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is exported during the year. (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (i) Total quantity of GHG aggregated for all GHG from all applicable supply categories in Table A–5 of this subpart and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (A) Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units). (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for which GHG emission were calculated. (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type. These data include but are not limited to the following information in this paragraph (g)(2): (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used. For data required by § 98.5(b) to be entered into verification software specified in § 98.5(b), maintain the entered data in the format generated by the verification software according to § 98.5(b). (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 means carbon dioxide emissions generated as the result of biomass combustion from combustion units for which emission calculations are required by an applicable part 98 subpart. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Destruction efficiency means the efficiency with which a destruction device reduces the mass of a greenhouse gas fed into the device. Destruction efficiency, or flaring destruction efficiency, refers to the fraction of the gas that leaves the flare partially or fully oxidized. The destruction efficiency is expressed in Equation A–2 of this section: Global warming potential or GWP means the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of one kilogram of a trace substance relative to that of one kilogram of a reference gas (i.e., CO<E T=""52"">2). GWPs for each greenhouse gas are provided in Table A–1 of this subpart. For purposes of the calculations in this part, if the GHG has a chemical-specific GWP listed in Table A–1, use that GWP. Otherwise, use the default GWP provided in Table A–1 for the fluorinated GHG group of which the GHG is a member. Greenhouse gas or GHG means carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2), methane (CH<E T=""52"">4), nitrous oxide (N<E T=""52"">2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and other fluorinated greenhouse gases as defined in this section. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. (4) Emissions Inventory Improvement Program, Volume II: Chapter 16, Methods for Estimating Air Emissions from Chemical Manufacturing Facilities, August 2007, Final, http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/eiip/techreport/volume02/index.html, IBR approved for § 98.123(c)(1)(i)(A). (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (iv) An oxygen (O<E T=""52"">2) concentration monitor may be used in lieu of a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 concentrations, in accordance with Equation F–14a or F–14b (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, if the effluent gas stream monitored by the CEMS consists solely of combustion products (i.e., no process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions or CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from sorbent are mixed with the combustion products) and if only fuels that are listed in Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter are combusted in the unit. If the O<E T=""52"">2 monitoring option is selected, the F-factors used in Equations F–14a and F–14b shall be determined according to section 3.3.5 or section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable. If Equation F–14b is used, the hourly moisture percentage in the stack gas shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. (v) Each hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack. (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate at each set point. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (G) Finally, add the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the unit. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Use the hourly heat input data from appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, together with Equation G–4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates, in units of tons/hr; (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons; and (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons, using Equation LM–11 in § 75.19(c)(4)(iii) of this chapter. (B) Sum the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions values over the entire reporting year to obtain the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (A) Use Equation F–11 or F–2 (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates from the CEMS data. If an O<E T=""52"">2 monitor is used, convert the hourly average O<E T=""52"">2 readings to CO<E T=""52"">2 using Equation F–14a or F–14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (as applicable), before applying Equation F–11 or F–2. (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (iv) For units that qualify to use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methods in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(iii) of this section, if both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, separate calculation and reporting of the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) is optional, only for the 2010 reporting year, as provided in § 98.3(c)(12). (b) Use of the four tiers. Use of the four tiers of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methodologies described in paragraph (a) of this section is subject to the following conditions, requirements, and restrictions: (A) The use of Tier 1 or 2 is permitted, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii), (b)(1)(v), (b)(1)(viii), and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (c) Calculation of CH<E T=""54"">4 and N<E T=""54"">2O emissions from stationary combustion sources. You must calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions only for units that are required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the calculation methodologies of this subpart and for only those fuels that are listed in Table C–2 of this subpart. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation.

Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: bbl means barrel. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Unstabilized crude oil means, for the purposes of this part, crude oil that is pumped from the well to a pipeline or pressurized storage vessel for transport to the refinery without intermediate storage in a storage tank at atmospheric pressures. Unstabilized crude oil is characterized by having a true vapor pressure of 5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or greater.

(1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (A) If the results of fuel sampling are received monthly or more frequently, then for each unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than or equal to 100 mmBtu/hr (or for a group of units that includes at least one unit of that size), the annual average HHV shall be calculated using Equation C–2b of this section. If multiple HHV determinations are made in any month, average the values for the month arithmetically. (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (ii) When the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration is measured on a wet basis, Equation C–6 of this section is used to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 emission rates: (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (A) Calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons, using Equation LM–11 in § 75.19(c)(4)(iii) of this chapter. (B) Sum the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions values over the entire reporting year to obtain the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (A) Use Equation F–11 or F–2 (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates from the CEMS data. If an O<E T=""52"">2 monitor is used, convert the hourly average O<E T=""52"">2 readings to CO<E T=""52"">2 using Equation F–14a or F–14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (as applicable), before applying Equation F–11 or F–2. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (B) The fuel provides less than 10 percent of the annual heat input to the unit, or if § 98.36(c)(3) applies, to the group of units served by a common supply pipe. (B) The fuel provides 10% or more of the annual heat input to the unit or, if § 98.36(c)(3) applies, to the group of units served by a common supply pipe. (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation. (ii) Use Equation C–8b to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu. (2) Use Equation C–9a of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 2 Equation C–2a of this section to estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions. Use the same values for fuel consumption and HHV that you use for the Tier 2 calculation. (ii) If more than one type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart is combusted during the reporting year, use Equation C–10 of this section separately for each type of fuel, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. Determine the appropriate values of (HI)<E T=""52"">A as follows: (C) For Tier 4 units, use the best available information (e.g., fuel feed rate measurements, fuel heating values, engineering analysis) to estimate the value of (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each type of fuel. Instrumentation used to make these estimates is not subject to the calibration requirements of § 98.3(i) or to the QA requirements of § 98.34. (5) When multiple fuels are combusted during the reporting year, sum the fuel-specific results from Equations C–8, C–8a, C–8b, C–9a, C–9b, or C–10 of this section (as applicable) to obtain the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions, in metric tons. (1) You may use Equation C–1 of this subpart to calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the combustion of the biomass fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (except MSW and tires), in a unit of any size, including units equipped with a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS, except when the use of Tier 2 is required as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. Determine the quantity of biomass combusted using one of the following procedures in this paragraph (e)(1), as appropriate, and document the selected procedures in the Monitoring Plan under § 98.3(g): (ii) Sum all of the hourly V<E T=""52"">CO2h values for the reporting year, to obtain V<E T=""52"">total, the total annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted. (iii) Calculate the annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion using Equation C–13 of this section. If two or more types of fossil fuel are combusted during the year, perform a separate calculation with Equation C–13 of this section for each fuel and sum the results. (iv) Subtract V<E T=""52"">ff from V<E T=""52"">total to obtain V<E T=""52"">bio, the annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 from the combustion of biomass. (ii) Determine the relative proportions of biogenic and non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in the flue gas on a quarterly basis using the method specified in § 98.34(d) (for units that combust MSW as the primary fuel or as the only fuel with a biogenic component) or in § 98.34(e) (for other units, including units that combust tires). (iii) Determine the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the unit by multiplying the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by the annual average biogenic decimal fraction obtained from § 98.34(d) or § 98.34(e), as applicable. (iv) If the combustion of MSW and/or tires provides no more than 10 percent of the annual heat input to a unit, or if a small, batch incinerator combusts no more than 1,000 tons per year of MSW, you may estimate the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions as follows, in lieu of following the procedures in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section: (A) Calculate the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from combustion of MSW and/or tires in the unit, using the Tier 1 calculation methodology in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (ii) For coal and fuel oil, and for any other solid or liquid fuel that is delivered in lots, analysis of at least one representative sample from each fuel lot is required. For fuel oil, as an alternative to sampling each fuel lot, a sample may be taken upon each addition of oil to the unit's storage tank. Flow proportional sampling, continuous drip sampling, or daily manual oil sampling may also be used, in lieu of sampling each fuel lot. If the daily manual oil sampling option is selected, sampling from a particular tank is required only on days when oil from the tank is combusted by the unit (or units) served by the tank. If you elect to sample from the storage tank upon each addition of oil to the tank, you must take at least one sample from each tank that is currently in service and whenever oil is added to the tank, for as long as the tank remains in service. You need not take any samples from a storage tank while it is out of service. Rather, take a sample when the tank is brought into service and whenever oil is added to the tank, for as long as the tank remains in service. If multiple additions of oil are made to a particular in-service tank on a given day (e.g., from multiple deliveries), one sample taken after the final addition of oil is sufficient. For the purposes of this section, a fuel lot is defined as a shipment or delivery of a single type of fuel (e.g., ship load, barge load, group of trucks, group of railroad cars, oil delivery via pipeline from a tank farm, etc.). However, if multiple deliveries of a particular type of fuel are received from the same supply source in a given calendar month, the deliveries for that month may be considered, collectively, to comprise a fuel lot, requiring only one representative sample, subject to the following conditions: (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (i) If the fuels to be blended are received separately, and if the quantity (mass or volume) of each fuel is measured before the fuels are mixed and combusted, then, for each component of the blend, calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately. Substitute into Equation C–2a of this subpart the total measured mass or volume of the component fuel (from company records), together with the appropriate default CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor from Table C–1, and the annual average HHV, calculated according to § 98.33(a)(2)(ii). In this case, the fact that the fuels are blended prior to combustion is of no consequence. (ii) If the fuel is received as a blend (i.e., already mixed) or if the components are mixed on site without precisely measuring the mass or volume of each one individually, a reasonable estimate of the relative proportions of the components of the blend must be made, using the best available information (e.g., the approximate annual average mass or volume percentage of each fuel, based on the typical or expected range of values). Determine the appropriate CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor and HHV for use in Equation C–2a of this subpart, as follows: (A) Consider the blend to be the “fuel type,” measure its HHV at the frequency prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, and determine the annual average HHV value for the blend according to § 98.33(a)(2)(ii). (C) Substitute into Equation C–2a of this subpart, the annual average HHV for the blend (from paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section) and the calculated value of (EF)<E T=""52"">B, along with the total mass or volume of the blend combusted during the reporting year, to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from combustion of the blend. (iii) Note that for the case described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if measured HHV values for the individual fuels in the blend or for the blend itself are not routinely received at the minimum frequency prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (or at a greater frequency), and if the unit qualifies to use Tier 1, calculate (HHV)<E T=""52"">B*, the heat-weighted default HHV for the blend, using Equation C–17 of this section. Then, use Equation C–16 of this section, replacing the term (HHV)<E T=""52"">B with (HHV)<E T=""52"">B* in the denominator, to determine the heat-weighted CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor for the blend. Finally, substitute into Equation C–1 of this subpart, the calculated values of (HHV)<E T=""52"">B* and (EF)<E T=""52"">B, along with the total mass or volume of the blend combusted during the reporting year, to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from combustion of the blend. (1) You must calibrate each oil and gas flow meter according to § 98.3(i) and the provisions of this paragraph (b)(1). (2) Oil tank drop measurements (if used to determine liquid fuel use volume) shall be performed according to any an appropriate method published by a consensus-based standards organization (e.g., the American Petroleum Institute). (B) For coal and fuel oil and for any other solid or liquid fuel that is delivered in lots, analysis of at least one representative sample from each fuel lot is required. For fuel oil, as an alternative to sampling each fuel lot, a sample may be taken upon each addition of oil to the storage tank. Flow proportional sampling, continuous drip sampling, or daily manual oil sampling may also be used, in lieu of sampling each fuel lot. If the daily manual oil sampling option is selected, sampling from a particular tank is required only on days when oil from the tank is combusted by the unit (or units) served by the tank. If you elect to sample from the storage tank upon each addition of oil to the tank, you must take at least one sample from each tank that is currently in service and whenever oil is added to the tank, for as long as the tank remains in service. You need not take any samples from a storage tank while it is out of service. Rather, take a sample when the tank is brought into service and whenever oil is added to the tank, for as long as the tank remains in service. If multiple additions of oil are made to a particular in service tank on a given day (e.g., from multiple deliveries), one sample taken after the final addition of oil is sufficient. For the purposes of this section, a fuel lot is defined as a shipment or delivery of a single type of fuel (e.g., ship load, barge load, group of trucks, group of railroad cars, oil delivery via pipeline from a tank farm, etc.). However, if multiple deliveries of a particular type of fuel are received from the same supply source in a given calendar month, the deliveries for that month may be considered, collectively, to comprise a fuel lot, requiring only one representative sample, subject to the following conditions: (C) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil and for biogas, sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (1) Fuel consumption, when the Tier 1 and Tier 2 Calculation Methodologies are used, including cases where § 98.36(c)(4) applies. (3) Fossil fuel consumption when § 98.33(e)(2) applies to a unit that uses CEMS to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions and that combusts both fossil and biomass fuels. (7) Fuel usage for CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions calculations under § 98.33(c)(4)(ii).

(11) Quarterly kiln-specific CKD CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factors for each kiln (metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2/metric ton CKD produced). (17) Annual average clinker CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor for the facility, averaged across all kilns (metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2/metric ton clinker produced). (18) Annual average CKD CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor for the facility, averaged across all kilns (metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2/metric ton CKD produced). (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (i) When you are calculating preliminary estimates for the purpose of this paragraph (i)(1), you must consider the subscript “j” in Equations I–8 and I–9, and I–13 of this subpart to mean “stack system” instead of “process sub-type or process type.” For the value of a<E T=""52"">ij, the fraction of input gas i that is used in tools with abatement systems, for use in Equations I–8 and I–9, you may use the ratio of the number of tools using input gas i that have abatement systems that are vented to the stack system for which you are calculating the preliminary estimate to the total number of tools using input gas i that are vented to that stack system, expressed as a decimal fraction. In calculating the preliminary estimates, you must account for the effect of any fluorinated GHG abatement system meeting the definition of abatement system in § 98.98. You may use this approach to determining a<E T=""52"">ij only for this preliminary estimate. (ii) You must use representative data from the previous reporting year to estimate the consumption of input gas i as calculated in Equation I–13 of this subpart and the fraction of input gas i and by-product gas k destroyed in abatement systems for each stack system as calculated by Equations I–24A and I–24B of this subpart. If you were not required to submit an annual report under subpart I for the previous reporting year and data from the previous reporting year are not available, you may estimate the consumption of input gas i and the fraction of input gas i destroyed in abatement systems based on representative operating data from a period of at least 30 days in the current reporting year. When calculating the consumption of input gas i using Equation I–13 of this subpart, the term “f<E T=""52"">ij” is replaced with the ratio of the number of tools using input gas i that are vented to the stack system for which you are calculating the preliminary estimate to the total number of tools in the fab using input gas i, expressed as a decimal fraction. You may use this approach to determining f<E T=""52"">ij only for this preliminary estimate. (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 pe","Yes, the term “throughput” refers to the volume of natural gas flowing out of the AGR unit.",,,,,1,0.0437956204,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,,,870,,
53,In 98.233.d.8 are we allowed to assume that volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas out of the AGR unit is zero?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emission from the data. The equation that should be used for centrifugal compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities is EF = Fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor, from Table C–1 of this subpart (kg CO2/mmBtu). The extraction explains that EF represents the fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor, which is obtained from Table C–1 of the subpart and is measured in kilograms of CO2 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) of fuel.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year.

(v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph.

Absorbent circulation pump means a pump commonly powered by natural gas pressure that circulates the absorbent liquid between the absorbent regenerator and natural gas contactor. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor means any equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by centrifugal action, employing rotating movement of the driven shaft. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor dry seals mean a series of rings around the compressor shaft where it exits the compressor case that operates mechanically under the opposing forces to prevent natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 from escaping to the atmosphere. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. Continuous bleed means a continuous flow of pneumatic supply natural gas to the process control device (e.g. level control, temperature control, pressure control) where the supply gas pressure is modulated by the process condition, and then flows to the valve controller where the signal is compared with the process set-point to adjust gas pressure in the valve actuator. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fluid coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced in a fluidized bed system. The fluid coking unit includes equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for heat recovery on the fluid coking burner exhaust vent. There are two basic types of fluid coking units: A traditional fluid coking unit in which only a small portion of the coke produced in the unit is burned to fuel the unit and the fluid coking burner exhaust vent is directed to the atmosphere (after processing in a CO boiler or other air pollutant control equipment) and a flexicoking unit in which an auxiliary burner is used to partially combust a significant portion of the produced petroleum coke to generate a low value fuel gas that is used as fuel in other combustion sources at the refinery. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. High-bleed pneumatic devices are automated, continuous bleed flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate in excess of 6 standard cubic feet per hour. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Intermittent bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for automatically maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. These are snap-acting or throttling devices that discharge all or a portion of the full volume of the actuator intermittently when control action is necessary, but does not bleed continuously. Liberated means released from coal and surrounding rock strata during the mining process. This includes both methane emitted from the ventilation system and methane drained from degasification systems. Low-bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate equal to or less than six standard cubic feet per hour. Natural gas driven pneumatic pump means a pump that uses pressurized natural gas to move a piston or diaphragm, which pumps liquids on the opposite side of the piston or diaphragm. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Reciprocating compressor means a piece of equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by positive displacement, employing linear movement of a shaft driving a piston in a cylinder. Reciprocating compressor rod packing means a series of flexible rings in machined metal cups that fit around the reciprocating compressor piston rod to create a seal limiting the amount of compressed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 that escapes to the atmosphere. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Unstabilized crude oil means, for the purposes of this part, crude oil that is pumped from the well to a pipeline or pressurized storage vessel for transport to the refinery without intermediate storage in a storage tank at atmospheric pressures. Unstabilized crude oil is characterized by having a true vapor pressure of 5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or greater. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Ventilation hole or shaft means a vent hole, shaft, mine portal, adit or other mine entrance or exits employed at an underground coal mine to serve as the outlet or conduit to move air from the ventilation system out of the mine. Ventilation system means a system that is used to control the concentration of methane and other gases within mine working areas through mine ventilation, rather than a mine degasification system. A ventilation system consists of fans that move air through the mine workings to dilute methane concentrations. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wellhead means the piping, casing, tubing and connected valves protruding above the earth's surface for an oil and/or natural gas well. The wellhead ends where the flow line connects to a wellhead valve. Wellhead equipment includes all equipment, permanent and portable, located on the improved land area (i.e. well pad) surrounding one or multiple wellheads. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98.

(3) Irrigation pumps at agricultural operations. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (1) The Tier 1 Calculation Methodology: (2) The Tier 2 Calculation Methodology: (ii) May be used in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr for the combustion of natural gas and/or distillate fuel oil. (3) The Tier 3 Calculation Methodology: (4) The Tier 4 Calculation Methodology: (F) The installed gas or stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors are required, either by an applicable Federal or State regulation or by the unit's operating permit, to undergo periodic quality assurance testing in accordance with either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met. (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (5) The Tier 4 Calculation Methodology shall be used: (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (A) Under paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section, for units using the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. (a) For the Tier 2 Calculation Methodology: (b) For the Tier 3 Calculation Methodology: (1) You must calibrate each oil and gas flow meter according to § 98.3(i) and the provisions of this paragraph (b)(1). (i) §§ 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. (4) Sorbent usage, when § 98.33(d) applies. (5) Quantity of steam generated by a unit when § 98.33(a)(2)(iii) applies. (6) Biogenic fuel consumption and high heating value, as applicable, under §§ 98.33(e)(5) and (e)(6). (8) Mass of biomass combusted, for premixed fuels that contain biomass and fossil fuels under § 98.33(e)(1)(iii). (1) Aggregation of units. If a facility contains two or more units (e.g., boilers or combustion turbines), each of which has a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less, you may report the combined GHG emissions for the group of units in lieu of reporting GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the use of Tier 4 is not required or elected for any of the units and the units use the same tier for any common fuels combusted. If this option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (2) Monitored common stack or duct configurations. When the flue gases from two or more stationary fuel combustion units at a facility are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere and if CEMS are used to continuously monitor CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions at the common stack or duct according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, you may report the combined emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units. This monitoring and reporting alternative may also be used when process off-gases or a mixture of combustion products and process gases are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere. Whenever the common stack or duct monitoring option is applied, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (x) For each type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart that was combusted during the report year in the units sharing the common stack or duct during the report year, the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (ii) On an annual basis, at least 95 percent (by mass or volume) of the shared fuel is combusted in the large combustion unit(s), and the remainder is combusted in the small combustion sources. Company records may be used to determine the percentage distribution of the shared fuel to the large and small units; and (ii) Use the alternative methods for units with continuous monitoring systems provided in § 98.33(a)(5). (i) For the Tier 1 Calculation Methodology, report: (ii) For the Tier 2 Calculation Methodology, report: (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. In addition to the requirements of § 98.3(g), you must retain: (a) The applicable records specified in §§ 98.34(f), 98.35(b), and 98.36(e). (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (1) You must conduct the test on the vent stream from the nitric acid oxidation step of the process, referred to as the test point, according to the methods specified in § 98.54(b) through (f). If multiple adipic acid production units exhaust to a common abatement technology and/or emission point, you must sample each process in the ducts before the emissions are combined, sample each process when only one process is operating, or sample the combined emissions when multiple processes are operating and base the site-specific emission factor on the combined production rate of the multiple adipic acid production units.

(i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than January 31, 2015. (x) EOR hydrocarbon liquids. You must indicate whether hydrocarbon liquids were produced through EOR operations. If hydrocarbon liquids were produced through EOR operations, you must report the information specified in paragraphs (x)(1) through (4) of this section for each sub-basin category with EOR operations. Basin means geologic provinces as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Geologic Note: AAPG–CSD Geologic Provinces Code Map: AAPG Bulletin, Prepared by Richard F. Meyer, Laure G. Wallace, and Fred J. Wagner, Jr., Volume 75, Number 10 (October 1991) (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7) and the Alaska Geological Province Boundary Map, Compiled by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Committee on Statistics of Drilling in Cooperation with the USGS, 1978 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). Sub-basin category, for onshore natural gas production, means a subdivision of a basin into the unique combination of wells with the surface coordinates within the boundaries of an individual county and subsurface completion in one or more of each of the following five formation types: Oil, high permeability gas, shale gas, coal seam, or other tight gas reservoir rock. The distinction between high permeability gas and tight gas reservoirs shall be designated as follows: High permeability gas reservoirs with &gt;0.1 millidarcy permeability, and tight gas reservoirs with ≤0.1 millidarcy permeability. Permeability for a reservoir type shall be determined by engineering estimate. Wells that produce only from high permeability gas, shale gas, coal seam, or other tight gas reservoir rock are considered gas wells; gas wells producing from more than one of these formation types shall be classified into only one type based on the formation with the most contribution to production as determined by engineering knowledge. All wells that produce hydrocarbon liquids (with or without gas) and do not meet the definition of a gas well in this sub-basin category definition are considered to be in the oil formation. All emission sources that handle condensate from gas wells in high permeability gas, shale gas, or tight gas reservoir rock formations are considered to be in the formation that the gas well belongs to and not in the oil formation.

55,For AGR vents is the use of a meter to measure flow rates required?,"The document mentioned the reporting requirements for stationary fuel combustion sources under Subpart C and the reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems under Subpart W. It specifies the conditions for reporting annual GHG emissions, calculation methodologies for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, and the conditions for discontinuing reporting. It also provides information on report submission timing and the use of best available monitoring methods. The document defines terms related to combustion equipment and provides specific ASTM standards for testing the heat of combustion of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Based on the information provided, combustion equipment triggering Subpart C reporting should be reported separately under Subpart C, and petroleum and natural gas systems should be reported under Subpart W. Therefore, there will be 2 separate reporting schemas for Subpart C and Subpart W.","(a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart.

For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. For these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the subparts listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c).

(i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions.

The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (2) Year and months covered by the report. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (vii) The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–6 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2011 until March 31, 2013. The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–7 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2013 until March 31, 2015 (as part of the annual report for reporting year 2014), except as otherwise specified in Table A–7 of this subpart. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (ii) The year and months covered by the report. (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (h) Annual GHG report revisions. This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (3) Timing of request. (i) The initial notice of intent must be submitted no later than January 1, 2011, or by the end of the approved use of best available monitoring methods extension in 2010, whichever is earlier.

(2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than January 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (b) For reporting year 2014 and thereafter, unless a later year is specified in the applicable recordkeeping section, you must enter into verification software specified by the Administrator the data specified in the verification software records provision in each applicable recordkeeping section. For each data element entered into the verification software, if the software produces a warning message for the data value and you elect not to revise the data value, you may provide an explanation in the verification software of why the data value is not being revised. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Chemical recovery combustion unit means a combustion device, such as a recovery furnace or fluidized-bed reactor where spent pulping liquor from sulfite or semi-chemical pulping processes is burned to recover pulping chemicals. Chemical recovery furnace means an enclosed combustion device where concentrated spent liquor produced by the kraft or soda pulping process is burned to recover pulping chemicals and produce steam. Includes any recovery furnace that burns spent pulping liquor produced from both the kraft and soda pulping processes. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Destruction device, for the purposes of subparts II and TT of this part, means a flare, thermal oxidizer, boiler, turbine, internal combustion engine, or any other combustion unit used to destroy or oxidize methane contained in landfill gas or wastewater biogas. Destruction efficiency means the efficiency with which a destruction device reduces the mass of a greenhouse gas fed into the device. Destruction efficiency, or flaring destruction efficiency, refers to the fraction of the gas that leaves the flare partially or fully oxidized. The destruction efficiency is expressed in Equation A–2 of this section: Emergency equipment means any auxiliary fossil fuel-powered equipment, such as a fire pump, that is used only in emergency situations. Flare means a combustion device, whether at ground level or elevated, that uses an open flame to burn combustible gases with combustion air provided by uncontrolled ambient air around the flame. Fluid coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced in a fluidized bed system. The fluid coking unit includes equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for heat recovery on the fluid coking burner exhaust vent. There are two basic types of fluid coking units: A traditional fluid coking unit in which only a small portion of the coke produced in the unit is burned to fuel the unit and the fluid coking burner exhaust vent is directed to the atmosphere (after processing in a CO boiler or other air pollutant control equipment) and a flexicoking unit in which an auxiliary burner is used to partially combust a significant portion of the produced petroleum coke to generate a low value fuel gas that is used as fuel in other combustion sources at the refinery. Fuel means solid, liquid or gaseous combustible material. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Gaseous fuel means a material that is in the gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions and that is combusted to produce heat and/or energy. Maximum rated input capacity means the maximum charging rate of a municipal waste combustor unit expressed in tons per day of municipal solid waste combusted, calculated according to the procedures under 40 CFR 60.58b(j). Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Primary fuel means the fuel that provides the greatest percentage of the annual heat input to a stationary fuel combustion unit. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Reporting year means the calendar year during which the GHG data are required to be collected for purposes of the annual GHG report. For example, reporting year 2014 is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the annual report for reporting year 2014 is submitted to EPA on March 31, 2015. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel.

(a) Stationary fuel combustion sources are devices that combust solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, generally for the purposes of producing electricity, generating steam, or providing useful heat or energy for industrial, commercial, or institutional use, or reducing the volume of waste by removing combustible matter. Stationary fuel combustion sources include, but are not limited to, boilers, simple and combined-cycle combustion turbines, engines, incinerators, and process heaters. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (i) Equation C–2a of this section applies to any type of fuel listed in Table C–1 of the subpart, except for municipal solid waste (MSW). For MSW combustion, use Equation C–2c of this section. (iii) For units that combust municipal solid waste (MSW) and that produce steam, use Equation C–2c of this section. Equation C–2c of this section may also be used for any other solid fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart provided that steam is generated by the unit.

May we use a flow meter to calculate annual emission CO2?,"The document mentioned several tables providing default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. These tables include emission factors for various components and equipment, as well as average component counts for different types of equipment. However, there is no specific indication in the provided information that any changes need to be made to the RY2010 report when transitioning to reporting under subpart W for RY2011.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources.

If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere.

Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section for wells with annual average daily oil production greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day that flow directly to atmospheric","The units of measure for emissions calculated in Equation W-3 are in cubic feet per year. However, §98.233(d)(10) requires that the volumetric emissions of equation W-3 be converted into mass emissions using §98.233(v)’s methods.  You must report emissions in metric tons of CO2e to meet the reporting requirements in §98.236(c)(3)(v).  If reporters use the methodology set forth in §98.233(d)(2), then a vent flow meter must be used to determine the total annual volume of vent gas flowing out of the AGR unit.",1,The answer does not address the question at all and provides irrelevant information about emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.,1,"The answer does not address the question asked about Equation W-3 and flow meters. It provides information about emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, which is not relevant to the question.",1,0.1538461538,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,3,The answer partially addresses the question but lacks coherence in some sentences and could be improved for better clarity.,483,,
57,"May average blowdown volumes be used for industry segments (processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports) where reporting of this emission source is required?","The document mentioned several tables providing emission factors and average component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. These tables include default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S. for reporting purposes, whole gas leaker emission factors, and total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing. However, the document does not directly address whether basin emissions should be reported under the same facility registration for different reporting years. Therefore, further information or clarification may be needed to directly answer the question.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part.

(1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions.

If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010.

The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (ii) No later than January 1, 2011, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on January 1, 2010, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have not been installed and certified by January 1, 2010. In this case, you may use Tier 2 or Tier 3 to report GHG emissions for 2010. However, if the required CEMS are certified some time in 2010, you need not wait until January 1, 2011 to begin using Tier 4. Rather, you may switch from Tier 2 or Tier 3 to Tier 4 as soon as CEMS certification testing is successfully completed. If this reporting option is chosen, you must document the change in CO<E T=""52"">2 calculation methodology in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5) and in the GHG emissions report under § 98.3(c). Data recorded by the CEMS during a certification test period in 2010 may be used for reporting under this part, provided that the following two conditions are met: (4) Use Equation C–10 of this section for: units subject to subpart D of this part; units that qualify for and elect to use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methodologies described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section; and units that use the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. (2) The total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions reported for the unit shall include the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion process and the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the sorbent. (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). (C) From the electronic data report required under § 75.64 of this chapter, for units in the Acid Rain Program and other units using CEMS to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions according to part 75 of this chapter. However, before calculating the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, multiply the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by 0.91 to convert from short tons to metric tons. (ii) Determine the relative proportions of biogenic and non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in the flue gas on a quarterly basis using the method specified in § 98.34(d) (for units that combust MSW as the primary fuel or as the only fuel with a biogenic component) or in § 98.34(e) (for other units, including units that combust tires). The CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data for stationary fuel combustion sources shall be monitored as follows: (i) §§ 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. (3) For ongoing quality assurance, follow the applicable procedures in either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. If appendix F to part 60 of this chapter is selected for on-going quality assurance, perform daily calibration drift assessments for both the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and the flow rate monitor, conduct cylinder gas audits of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor in three of the four quarters of each year (except for non-operating quarters), and perform annual RATAs of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and the CERMS. (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (i) If the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS consists entirely of non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 (i.e., CO<E T=""52"">2 from fossil fuel combustion plus, if applicable, CO<E T=""52"">2 from sorbent and/or process CO<E T=""52"">2), report the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, expressed in metric tons. You are not required to report the combustion CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions by fuel type. (ii) Report the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS. If this total includes both biogenic and non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, separately report the annual non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from biomass combustion, each expressed in metric tons. You are not required to report the combustion CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions by fuel type. (1) Aggregation of units. If a facility contains two or more units (e.g., boilers or combustion turbines), each of which has a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less, you may report the combined GHG emissions for the group of units in lieu of reporting GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the use of Tier 4 is not required or elected for any of the units and the units use the same tier for any common fuels combusted. If this option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (ii) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions at each monitored location, expressed in both short tons and metric tons. Separate reporting of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions under § 98.3(c)(4)(ii) and § 98.3(c)(4)(iii)(A) is optional only for the 2010 reporting year, as provided in § 98.3(c)(12). (2) For units that use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods provided in § 98.33(a)(5), you shall report the following unit-level information: (iii) Are not in the Acid Rain Program, but are required to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and heat input data year-round, in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. (B) The cumulative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in each quarter of the reporting year, i.e., the sum of the hourly values calculated from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this subpart (as applicable), in metric tons. (viii) If CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that are generated from acid gas scrubbing with sorbent injection are not captured using CEMS, report: (C) The ratio (“R”) in Equation C–11 of this subpart. (A) The results of each quarterly sample analysis, expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., if the biogenic fraction of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from MSW combustion is 30 percent, report 0.30). (B) The annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from MSW combustion, in metric tons. (xi) When ASTM methods D7459–08 and D6866–16 (both incorporated by reference, see § 98.7) are used in accordance with § 98.34(e) to determine the biogenic portion of the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from a unit that co-fires biogenic fuels (or partly-biogenic fuels, including tires if you are electing to report biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from tire combustion) and non-biogenic fuels, you shall report the results of each quarterly sample analysis, expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., if the biogenic fraction of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions is 30 percent, report 0.30). (a) The electricity generation source category comprises electricity generating units that are subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program and any other electricity generating units that are required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more electricity generating units and the facility meets the requirements of § 98.2(a)(1). (a) For each electricity generating unit that is subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program or is otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under this subpart the annual mass emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CH<E T=""52"">4 by following the requirements of this subpart. (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. (c) For each stationary fuel combustion unit that does not generate electricity, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C of this part. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, continue to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as required under § 75.13 or section 2.3 of appendix G to 40 CFR part 75, and § 75.64. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions as follows: (b) Calculate and report biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions under this subpart by following the applicable methods specified in § 98.33(e). The CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) for units subject to this subpart that are reported under §§ 98.3(c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(iii)(B) shall be calculated by subtracting the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculated according to § 98.33(e) from the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Separate calculation and reporting of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions is optional only for the 2010 reporting year pursuant to § 98.3(c)(12) and required every year thereafter. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains an adipic acid production process and the facility meets the requirements of either § 98.2(a)(1) or (2). (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (b) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C. (ii) You must notify the EPA of your use of a previously approved alternative method in your annual report. (iii) Otherwise, you must submit the request within 45 days following promulgation of this subpart or within the first 30 days of each subsequent reporting year. (i) You must determine the amount of process N<E T=""52"">2O emissions that is sold or transferred off site (if applicable). You can determine the amount using existing process flow meters and N<E T=""52"">2O analyzers. (1) Conduct the performance test annually. The test must be conducted at a point during production that is representative of the average emissions rate from your process. You must document the methods used to determine the representative point. (d) You must determine the volumetric flow rate during the performance test in conjunction with the applicable EPA methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendices A–1 through A–4. Conduct three emissions test runs of 1 hour each. All QA/QC procedures specified in the reference test methods and any associated performance specifications apply. For each test, the facility must prepare an emissions factor determination report that must include the items in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section: You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains an aluminum production process and the facility ","No, reporters must follow methods provided in §98.233(i) of the rule for determining unique physical volumes between isolation valves.",,,1,"The answer does not provide a clear and direct answer to the question asked. It provides information about emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, but does not address the specific question about using average blowdown volumes for reporting in certain industry segments.",1,0.0373831776,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,3,"The answer partially addresses the question but lacks coherence in some parts. It provides information about emission factors and average component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, but does not directly answer the question about using average blowdown volumes for reporting in certain industry segments.",685,,
58,"In 98.233(e), is the daily thoroughput for glycol dehydrators based on annual average daily thoroughput?","The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emissions from the data. Equations W-11A and W-11B are used to calculate annual volumetric total gas emissions, involving the conversion of gas flowback rates from actual conditions to standard conditions. The document also mentions the use of actual temperature and pressure to calculate natural gas volumetric emissions at standard conditions using specific equations. Therefore, the results of Equations W-11A and W-11B involve calculations that account for both actual conditions and standard conditions. Additionally, the document includes various tables providing default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and regions, which further support the calculation of emissions in both actual and standard conditions.","(A) You must demonstrate that measurements at the remote location(s) can, when appropriate correction factors are applied, reliably and accurately represent the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter under all expected ambient conditions. (D) You must use the mathematical correlation(s) derived from the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to convert the remote temperature or the total pressure readings, or both, to the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter, or both, on a daily basis. You shall then use the actual temperature and total pressure values to correct the measured flow rates to standard conditions. Gas conditions mean the actual temperature, volume, and pressure of a gas sample. Standard conditions or standard temperature and pressure (STP), for the purposes of this part, means either 60 or 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute. (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons; and (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons. (ii) If more than one type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart is combusted during the reporting year, use Equation C–10 of this section separately for each type of fuel, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. Determine the appropriate values of (HI)<E T=""52"">A as follows: (5) When multiple fuels are combusted during the reporting year, sum the fuel-specific results from Equations C–8, C–8a, C–8b, C–9a, C–9b, or C–10 of this section (as applicable) to obtain the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions, in metric tons. (4) If Equation C–1 or Equation C–2a of this section is selected to calculate the annual biogenic mass emissions for wood, wood waste, or other solid biomass-derived fuel, Equation C–15 of this section may be used to quantify biogenic fuel consumption, provided that all of the required input parameters are accurately quantified. Similar equations and calculation methodologies based on steam generation and boiler efficiency may be used, provided that they are documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required by § 98.3(g)(5). (12) Mass of each solid fuel combusted during month (tons) (Equation C–2b). (13) Volume of each liquid fuel combusted during month (gallons) (Equation C–2b). (2) You must conduct the performance test under normal process operating conditions. (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (viii) When using the stack testing option described in paragraph (i) of this section, you must calculate the weighted-average fraction of each fluorinated input gas i and each fluorinated byproduct gas k destroyed or removed in abatement systems for each fab f, as applicable, by using Equation I–24A (for input gases) and Equation I–24B (for by-product gases) of this subpart. (7) Records of all inputs and results of calculations made to determine the average weighted fraction of each gas destroyed or removed in the abatement systems for each stack system using Equations I–24A and I–24B of this subpart, if applicable. The inputs should include an indication of whether each value for destruction or removal efficiency is a default value or a measured site-specific value. (A) Previous test results, provided the tests are representative of current operating practices of the process. (B) Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data representative of the process operating conditions. Vapor pressures may be determined by standard reference texts or ASTM D–2879, (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (1) Conduct an annual performance test that is based on representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating conditions) of the affected process. You must calculate and report the annual GHG emissions as prescribed in this section. For calculations that specify measurements in actual conditions, reporters may use a flow or volume measurement system that corrects to standard conditions and determine the flow or volume at standard conditions; otherwise, reporters must use average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions as applicable to the respective monitoring methods in this section. (C) You may use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists or you may use an industry standard practice as specified in § 98.234(b) to sample and analyze wet natural gas composition. (2) Calculation Method 2. Calculate the total emissions for each sub-basin from well venting to the atmosphere for liquids unloading without plunger lift assist using Equation W–8 of this section. (3) Calculation Method 3. Calculate the total emissions for each sub-basin from well venting to the atmosphere for liquids unloading with plunger lift assist using Equation W–9 of this section. (g) Well venting during completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing. Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing using Equation W–10A or Equation W–10B of this section. Equation W–10A applies to well venting when the gas flowback rate is measured from a specified number of example completions or workovers and Equation W–10B applies when the gas flowback vent or flare volume is measured for each completion or workover. Completion and workover activities are separated into two periods, an initial period when flowback is routed to open pits or tanks and a subsequent period when gas content is sufficient to route the flowback to a separator or when the gas content is sufficient to allow measurement by the devices specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, regardless of whether a separator is actually utilized. If you elect to use Equation W–10A, you must follow the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(1). If you elect to use Equation W–10B, you must use a recording flow meter installed on the vent line, downstream of a separator and ahead of a flare or vent, to measure the gas flowback. For either equation, emissions must be calculated separately for completions and workovers, for each sub-basin, and for each well type combination identified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. You must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions as specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. If emissions from well venting during completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section. (1) If you elect to use Equation W–10A of this section on gas wells, you must use Calculation Method 1 as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, or Calculation Method 2 as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, to determine the value of FRM<E T=""52"">s and FRM<E T=""52"">i. If you elect to use Equation W–10A of this section on oil wells, you must use Calculation Method 1 as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) to determine the value of FRM<E T=""52"">s and FRM<E T=""52"">i. These values must be based on the flow rate for flowback gases, once sufficient gas is present to enable separation. The number of measurements or calculations required to estimate FRM<E T=""52"">s and FRM<E T=""52"">i must be determined individually for completions and workovers per sub-basin and well type combination as follows: Complete measurements or calculations for at least one completion or workover for less than or equal to 25 completions or workovers for each well type combination within a sub-basin; complete measurements or calculations for at least two completions or workovers for 26 to 50 completions or workovers for each sub-basin and well type combination; complete measurements or calculations for at least three completions or workovers for 51 to 100 completions or workovers for each sub-basin and well type combination; complete measurements or calculations for at least four completions or workovers for 101 to 250 completions or workovers for each sub-basin and well type combination; and complete measurements or calculations for at least five completions or workovers for greater than 250 completions or workovers for each sub-basin and well type combination. (i) Calculation Method 1. You must use Equation W–12A of this section as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section to determine the value of FRM<E T=""52"">s. You must use Equation W–12B of this section as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section to determine the value of FRM<E T=""52"">i. The procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(v) and (vi) of this section also apply. When making gas flowback measurements for use in Equations W–12A and W–12B of this section, you must use a recording flow meter (digital or analog) installed on the vent line, downstream of a separator and ahead of a flare or vent, to measure the gas flowback rates in units of standard cubic feet per hour according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b). (ii) Calculation Method 2 (for gas wells). You must use Equation W–12A as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section to determine the value of FRM<E T=""52"">s. You must use Equation W–12B as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section to determine the value of FRM<E T=""52"">i. The procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(v) and (vi) also apply. When calculating the flowback rates for use in Equations W–12A and W–12B of this section based on well parameters, you must record the well flowing pressure immediately upstream (and immediately downstream in subsonic flow) of a well choke according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b) to calculate the well flowback.

Therefore, it can be inferred that they meet the definition of dehydrator as used in the text.",1,0.0457142857,,,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a detailed explanation of the reporting requirements and definitions related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. However, it does not provide specific information about whether geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered as one basin or separate basins for defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",1145,,
60,The emission methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd in the preamble (use flow rate of wet NG and EF) contradict the requirements in the rule (use dehydrator count and EF).,"The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to monitor and regulate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from various sources such as equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. The requirement is based on the need to track and limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly those exceeding the threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year. The document outlines specific calculation methods and source types for reporting emissions, emphasizing the importance of accurate measurement and reporting of GHG quantities. Additionally, it provides detailed instructions for calculating emissions from different equipment and processes, such as well completions, well workovers, natural gas processing, transmission compression, and storage tanks. The regulations also cover specific methods for calculating emissions from different types of equipment, such as reciprocating compressor venting and wet seal oil degassing vents. Overall, the EPA's requirement for reporting by basin is aimed at ensuring comprehensive monitoring and control of GHG emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part.

For hydrocarbon liquids flowing to gas-liquid separators or non-separator equipment or directly to atmospheric storage tanks with throughput less than 10 barrels per day, use Calculation Method 3 as specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 for separators, you must also calculate emissions that may have occurred due to dump valves not closing properly using the method specified in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a vapor recovery system, you must adjust the emissions downward according to paragraph (j)(4) of this section.

(i) GHG mole fraction in produced natural gas for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. If you have a continuous gas composition analyzer for produced natural gas, you must use an annual average of these values for determining the mole fraction. If you do not have a continuous gas composition analyzer, then you must use an annual average gas composition based on your most recent available analysis of the sub-basin category or facility, as applicable to the emission source. (ii) GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for all emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities.

They can conduct tests such as ASTM D1826–94, ASTM D4891–89, ASTM D6060–96, ASTM D6348–03, GPA 2261–00, and Tracer Gas Protocol. Additionally, they can calculate GOR using Equation I–11 and Equation I–13 of the relevant subpart, and develop apportioning factors for gas consumption using a facility-specific engineering model or direct measurement with gas flow meters and weigh scales. Furthermore, they can estimate emissions using the emission factor or emission calculation factor method specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of the relevant section, and calculate emissions from venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers using Equation L–32 and Equation L–34 of the relevant section.

(D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (3) For ongoing quality assurance, follow the applicable procedures in either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. If appendix F to part 60 of this chapter is selected for on-going quality assurance, perform daily calibration drift assessments for both the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and the flow rate monitor, conduct cylinder gas audits of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor in three of the four quarters of each year (except for non-operating quarters), and perform annual RATAs of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and the CERMS. (4) For the purposes of this part, the stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor RATAs required by appendix B to part 75 of this chapter and the annual RATAs of the CERMS required by appendix F to part 60 of this chapter need only be done at one operating level, representing normal load or normal process operating conditions, both for initial certification and for ongoing quality assurance. (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (e) You must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed, on a fab basis, for each process sub-type or process type j, using Equation I–13 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–13 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). If you elect to calculate emissions using the stack test method in paragraph (i) of this section, you must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed on the applicable basis by using an appropriate apportioning factor. For example, when calculating fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG consumed using Equation I–21 of this section, you must substitute the term fij with the appropriate apportioning factor to calculate the total consumption of each fluorinated GHG in tools that are vented to stack systems that are tested. (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account for the anticipated change in your preliminary estimate. You may account for such a change using a quantifiable metric (e.g., the ratio of the number of tools that are expected to be vented to the stack system in the current year as compared to the previous reporting year, ratio of the expected number of wafer starts in the current reporting year as compared to the previous reporting year), engineering judgment, or other industry standard practice. (i) You must measure, and, if applicable, apportion the fab-specific fluorinated GHG consumption of the tools that are vented to the stack systems that are tested during the emission test as specified in § 98.94(j)(3). Calculate the consumption for each fluorinated GHG for the test period. (iii) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG input gas consumed (in kg of fluorinated GHG emitted per kg of input gas i consumed) in the tools that vent to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–19 of this subpart. If the emissions of input gas i exceed the consumption of input gas i during the sampling period, then equate “E<E T=""52"">is” to the consumption of input gas i and treat the difference between the emissions and consumption of input gas i as a by-product of the other input gases, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. (iv) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG formed as a by-product (in kg of fluorinated GHG per kg of total fluorinated GHG consumed) in the tools vented to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. When calculating the by-product emission factor for an input gas for which emissions exceeded its consumption, exclude the consumption of that input gas from the term “∑(Activity<E T=""52"">if).” (ii) Calculate emissions from consumption of each fluorinated GHG used in tools vented to stack systems that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (i)(2)(iii) of this section, and were not tested according to the procedures in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Calculate emissions using the default utilization and by-product formation rates and equations specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. If you are using a fluorinated GHG not listed in Tables I–11, I–12, I–13, I–14, or I–15 of this subpart, then you must assume utilization and by-product formation rates of zero for that fluorinated GHG. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (2) The trigger points for change out you use to calculate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your containers. If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas. (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (3) As an alternative to developing apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption using a fab-specific engineering model, you may develop apportioning factors through the use of direct measurement using gas flow meters and weigh scales to measure process sub-type, process type, stack system, or fab-specific input gas consumption. You may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a fab-specific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5). (3) If you use default destruction and removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), you must certify and document that the abatement systems at your facility for which you use default destruction or removal efficiency values are specifically designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. If you elect to calculate fluorinated GHG emissions using the stack test method under § 98.93(i), you must also certify that you have included and accounted for all abatement systems designed for fluorinated GHG abatement and any respective downtime in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(i)(3). (ii) You must measure for the expected and possible by-products identified in Table I–17 of this subpart and those fluorinated GHGs used as input fluorinated GHG in process tools vented to the stack system, except for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG as defined in § 98.98. You must calculate annual emissions of intermittent low-use fluorinated GHGs by adhering to the procedures in § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (3) Fab-specific fluorinated GHG consumption measurements. You must determine the amount of each fluorinated GHG consumed by each fab during the sampling period for all process tools connected to the stack systems tested under § 98.93(i)(3), according to the procedures in paragraphs (j)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. This determination must include apportioning gas consumption between stack systems that are being tested and those that are not tested under § 98.93(i)(2). (i) Measure fluorinated GHG consumption using gas flow meters, scales, or pressure measurements. Measure the mass or pressure, as applicable, at the beginning and end of the sampling period and when containers are changed out. If you elect to measure gas consumption using pressure (i.e., because the gas is stored in a location above its critical temperature) you must estimate consumption as specified in paragraphs (j)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. (3) Certification that the gas(es) you selected under § 98.94(c)(2)(ii) for each fab corresponds to the largest quantity(ies) consumed, on a mass basis, of fluorinated GHG used at your fab during the reporting year for which you are required to apportion. (2) Sample calculations used for developing the gas apportioning factors (f<E T=""52"">ij) for the two fluorinated GHGs used at your facility in the largest quantities, on a mass basis, during the reporting year. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. For fluorinated gas production and transformation processes, you must calculate the fluorinated GHG emissions from each process using the emission factor or emission calculation factor method specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, as appropriate. For destruction processes that destroy fluorinated GHGs that were previously “produced” as defined at § 98.410(b), you must calculate emissions using the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section. For venting of residual gas from containers (e.g., cylinder heels), you must calculate emissions using the procedures in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) Preliminary estimate of emissions by process vent. You must estimate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions of fluorinated GHGs for each process vent within each operating scenario of a continuous process using the approaches specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, accounting for any destruction as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. You must determine emissions of fluorinated GHGs by process vent by using measurements, by using calculations based on chemical engineering principles and chemical property data, or by conducting an engineering assessment. You may use previous measurements, calculations, and assessments if they represent current process operating conditions or process operating conditions that would result in higher fluorinated GHG emissions than the current operating conditions and if they were performed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, as applicable. You must document all data, assumptions, and procedures used in the calculations or engineering assessment and keep a record of the emissions determination as required by § 98.127(a). (B) You may determine the fluorinated GHG emissions from any process vent within the process using the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i) and (d)(3)(i)(B) of this chapter, except as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) through (c)(1)(i)(B)(4) of this section. For the purposes of this subpart, use of the term “HAP” in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i) and (d)(3)(i)(B) of this chapter means “fluorinated GHG”. (i) You must determine the flowrate of gas (or volume of gas), partial pressures of condensables, temperature (T), and fluorinated GHG molecular weight (MW<E T=""52"">Fluorinated GHG) at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver. (C) Maximum flow rate, fluorinated GHG emission rate, concentration, or other relevant parameters specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the process vent. (A) The destruction efficiencies of the device that have been demonstrated for the fluorinated GHGs in the vent stream for periods when the process vent is vented to the destruction device. (iv) Use of typical recent values. In the calculations in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the values used for the expected process activity and for the expected fraction of that activity whose emissions will be vented to the properly functioning destruction device must be based on either typical recent values for the process or values that would overestimate emissions from the process, unless there is a compelling reason to adopt a different value (e.g., installation of a destruction device for a previously uncontrolled process). If there is such a reason, it must be documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan. (i) If the calculations under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as well as any subsequent measurements and calculations under this subpart, indicate that the continuous process vent has fluorinated GHG emissions of less than 10,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year, summed across all operating scenarios, then you may comply with either paragraph (c)(3) of this section (Emission Factor approach) or paragraph (c)(4) of this section (Emission Calculation Factor approach). (A) You must conduct emission testing for process-vent-specific emission factor development before the destruction device unless the calculations you performed under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section indicate that the uncontrolled fluorinated GHG emissions that occur during periods when the process vent is not vented to the properly functioning destruction device are less than 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. In this case, you may conduct emission testing after the destruction device to develop a process-vent-specific emission factor. If you do so, you must develop and apply an emission calculation factor under paragraph (c)(4) to estimate emissions during any periods when the process vent is not vented to the properly functioning destruction device. (B) Regardless of the level of uncontrolled emissions, the emission testing for process-vent-specific emission factor development may be conducted on the outlet side of a wet scrubber in place for acid gas reduction, if one is in place, as long as there is no appreciable reduction in the fluorinated GHG. (3) Process-vent-specific emission factor method. For each process vent, conduct an emission test and measure fluorinated GHG emissions from the process and measure the process activity, such as the feed rate, production rate, or other process activity rate, during the test as described in this paragraph (c)(3). Conduct the emission test according to the procedures in § 98.124. All emissions test data and procedures used in developing emission factors must be documented according to § 98.127. If more than one operating scenario applies to the process that contains the subject process vent, you must comply with either paragraph (3)(i) or paragraph (3)(ii) of this section. (ii) Conduct an emissions test for the operating scenario that is expected to have the largest emissions in terms of CO<E T=""52"">2e (considering both activity levels and emission calculation factors) on an annual basis. Also conduct an emissions test for each additional operating scenario that is estimated to emit 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more annually from the vent and whose emission calculation factor differs by 15 percent or more from the emission calculation factor of the operating scenario that is expected to have the largest emissions (or of another operating scenario for which emission testing is performed), unless the difference between the operating scenarios is solely due to the application of a destruction device to emissions under one of the operating scenarios. For any other operating scenarios, adjust the process-vent specific emission factor developed for the operating scenario that is expected to have the largest emissions (or for another operating scenario for which emission testing is performed) using the approach in paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section. (iv) For continuous processes, you must calculate the hourly emission rate of each fluorinated GHG using Equation L–19 of this section and determine the hourly emission rate of each fluorinated GHG per process vent (and per operating scenario, as applicable) for the test run. (v) You must calculate a site-specific, process-vent-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG for each process vent and each operating scenario, in kg of fluorinated GHG per process activity rate (e.g., kg of feed or production), as applicable, using Equation L–20 of this section. For continuous processes, divide the hourly fluorinated GHG emission rate during the test by the hourly process activity rate during the test runs. (vi) If you conducted emissions testing after the destruction device, you must calculate the emissions of each fluorinated GHG for the process vent (and operating scenario, as applicable) using Equation L–21 of this section. You must also develop a process-vent-specific emission calculation factor based on paragraph (c)(4) of this section for the periods when the process vent is not venting to the destruction device. (vii) If you conducted emissions testing before the destruction device, apply the destruction efficiencies of the device that have been demonstrated for the fluorinated GHGs in the vent stream to the fluorinated GHG emissions for the process vent (and operating scenario, as applicable), using Equation L–22 of this section. You may apply the destruction efficiency only to the portion of the process activity during which emissions are vented to the properly functioning destruction device (i.e., controlled). (viii) Adjusted process-vent-specific emission factors for other operating scenarios. For process vents from processes with multiple operating scenarios, use Equation L–23 of this section to develop an adjusted process-vent-specific emission factor for each operating scenario from which the vent is estimated to emit less than 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e annually or whose emission calculation factor differs by less than 15 percent from the emission calculation factor of the operating scenario that is expected to have the largest emissions (or of another operating scenario for which emission testing is performed). (4) Process-vent-specific emission calculation factor method. For each process vent within an operating scenario, determine fluorinated GHG emissions by calculations and determine the process activity rate, such as the feed rate, production rate, or other process activity rate, associated with the emission rate. (i) You must calculate uncontrolled emissions of fluorinated GHG by individual process vent, E<E T=""52"">PV, by using measurements, by using calculations based on chemical engineering principles and chemical property data, or by conducting an engineering assessment. Use the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, except paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. The procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section may be applied either to batch process vents or to continuous process vents. The uncontrolled emissions must be based on a typical batch or production rate under a defined operating scenario. The process activity rate associated with the uncontrolled emissions must be determined. The methods, data, and assumptions used to estimate emissions for each operating scenario must be selected to yield a best estimate (expected value) of emissions rather than an over- or underestimate of emissions for that operating scenario. All data, assumptions, and procedures used in the calculations or engineering assessment must be documented according to § 98.127. (ii) You must calculate a site-specific, process-vent-specific emission calculation factor for each process vent, each operating scenario, and each fluorinated GHG, in kg of fluorinated GHG per activity rate (e.g., kg of feed or production) as applicable, using Equation L–25 of this section. (iii) You must calculate emissions of each fluorinated GHG for the process vent (and operating scenario, as applicable) for the year by multiplying the process-vent-specific emission calculation factor by the total process activity, as applicable, for the year, using Equation L–26 of this section. (iv) If the process vent is vented to a destruction device, apply the demonstrated destruction efficiency of the device to the fluorinated GHG emissions for the process vent (and operating scenario, as applicable), using Equation L–27 of this section. Apply the destruction efficiency only to the portion of the process activity that is vented to the properly functioning destruction device (i.e., controlled). (d) Calculate fluorinated GHG emissions for equipment leaks (EL). If you comply with paragraph (c) of this section, you must calculate the fluorinated GHG emissions from pieces of equipment associated with processes covered under this subpart and in fluorinated GHG service. If you conduct monitoring of equipment in fluorinated GHG service, monitoring must be conducted for those in light liquid and in gas and vapor service. If you conduct monitoring of equipment in fluorinated GHG service, you may exclude from monitoring each piece of equipment that is difficult-to-monitor, that is unsafe-to-monitor, that is insulated, or that is in heavy liquid service; you may exclude from monitoring each pump with dual mechanical seals, agitator with dual mechanical seals, pump with no external shaft, agitator with no external shaft; you may exclude from monitoring each pressure relief device in gas and vapor service with upstream rupture disk, each sampling connection system with closed-loop or closed-purge systems, and any pieces of equipment where leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device. You must estimate emissions using another approach for those pieces of equipment excluded from monitoring. Equipment that is in fluorinated GHG service for less than 300 hr/yr; equipment that is in vacuum service; pressure relief devices that are in light liquid service; and instrumentation systems are exempted from these requirements. (ii) Use of Other Approaches in EPA Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates in conjunction with EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using one of the following methods in EPA–453/R–95–017 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7): The Screening Ranges Approach; the EPA Correlation Approach; or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach. If you determine that EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7 is appropriate for monitoring a fluorinated GHG, and if you calibrate your instrument with a compound different from one or more of the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates to be measured, you must develop response factors for each fluorinated GHG or for each surrogate to be measured using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7. For each fluorinated GHG or surrogate measured, the response factor must be less than 10. The response factor is the ratio of the known concentration of a fluorinated GHG or surrogate to the observed meter reading when measured using an instrument calibrated with the reference compound. (2) You must collect information on the number of each type of equipment; the service of each piece of equipment (gas, light liquid, heavy liquid); the concentration of each fluorinated GHG in the stream; and the time period each piece of equipment was in service. Depending on which approach you follow, you may be required to collect information for equipment on the associated screening data concentrations for greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv and associated screening data concentrations for less than 10,000 ppmv; associated actual screening data concentrations; or associated screening data and leak rate data (i.e., bagging) used to develop a unit-specific correlation. (3) Calculate and sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG in metric tons per year for equipment pieces for each process, E<E T=""52"">ELf, annually. You must include and estimate emissions for types of equipment that are excluded from monitoring, including difficult-to-monitor, unsafe-to-monitor and insulated pieces of equipment, pieces of equipment in heavy liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment where leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device. (g) Emissions from venting of residual fluorinated GHGs in containers. If you vent residual fluorinated GHGs from containers, you must either measure the residual fluorinated GHGs vented from each container or develop a heel factor for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type that you vent. You do not need to estimate de minimis emissions associated with good-faith attempts to recycle or recover residual fluorinated GHGs in or from containers. (1) Measuring contents of each container. If you weigh or otherwise measure the contents of each container before venting the residual fluorinated GHGs, use Equation L–32 of this section to calculate annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG from venting of residual fluorinated GHG from containers. Convert pressures to masses as directed in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. (2) Developing and applying heel factors. If you use heel factors to estimate emissions of residual fluorinated GHGs vented from containers, you must annually develop these factors based on representative samples of the containers received by your facility from fluorinated GHG users. (i) Sample size. For each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type that you vent, select a representative sample of containers that reflects the full range of quantities of residual gas returned in that container size and type. This sample must reflect the full range of the industries and a broad range of the customers that use and return the fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type. The minimum sample size for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type must be 30, unless this is greater than the number of containers returned within that combination annually, in which case the contents of every container returned must be measured. (iv) Calculate annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG from venting of residual fluorinated GHG from containers using Equation L–34 of this section. (c) Emission factor testing. If you determine fluorinated GHG emissions using the site-specific process-vent-specific emission factor, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(8) of this section. (1) Process vent testing. Conduct an emissions test that is based on representative performance of the process or operating scenario(s) of the process, as applicable. For process vents for which you performed an initial scoping speciation, include in the emission test any fluorinated GHG that was identified in the initial scoping speciation. For process vents for which you did not perform an initial scoping speciation, include in the emission test any fluorinated greenhouse gas that occurs in more than trace concentrations in the vent stream or, where a destruction device is used, in the inlet to the destruction device. You may include startup and shutdown events if the testing is sufficiently long or comprehensive to ensure that such events are not overrepresented in the emission factor. Malfunction events must not be included in the testing. If you do not detect a fluorinated GHG that was identified in the scoping speciation or that occurs in more than trace concentrations in the vent stream or in the inlet to the destruction device, assume that fluorinated GHG was emitted at one half of the detection limit. (2) Number of runs. For continuous processes, sample the process vent for a minimum of three runs of 1 hour each. If the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the emission factor calculated based on the first three runs is greater than or equal to 0.15 for the emission factor, continue to sample the process vent for an additional three runs of 1 hour each. If more than one fluorinated GHG is measured, the RSD must be expressed in terms of total CO<E T=""52"">2e. (iii) You may sample the combined emissions and use engineering calculations and assessments as specified in § 98.123(c)(4) to allocate the emissions to each manifolded process vent, provided the sum of the calculated fluorinated GHG emissions across the individual process vents is within 20 percent of the total fluorinated GHG emissions measured during the manifolded testing. (7) Subsequent measurements. If a continuous process vent with fluorinated GHG emissions less than 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52","Emissions from glycol dehydrators with annual average daily throughputs less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day must be reported using the requirements of Â§98.233 (e)(2), Calculation Methodology 2.",1,"The answer does not address the question about using GRI-GLYCalc instead of Method 2 for onshore petroleum and natural gas facility dehydrator vents at glycol dehydrators with throughputs less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day.

Is this throughput specific to vent throughput or dehydrator throughput?","The document outlines the mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for facilities and suppliers, including the conditions under which an owner or operator may discontinue complying with the reporting requirements based on reported emissions thresholds. It specifies that if reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year for five consecutive years, the owner or operator may discontinue complying with the reporting requirements, provided a notification is submitted to the Administrator. Similar provisions exist for reported emissions less than 15,000 metric tons CO2e per year for three consecutive years. The document also details the schedule for submitting annual GHG reports and provides information on requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. However, there is no specific mention of optional delayed reporting requirements for wildcat wells and delineation wells.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (vii) The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–6 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2011 until March 31, 2013. The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–7 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2013 until March 31, 2015 (as part of the annual report for reporting year 2014), except as otherwise specified in Table A–7 of this subpart. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31, 2010. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be purchased and delivered by April 1, 2010, include supporting documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was ordered, investigation of alternative suppliers and the dates by which alternative vendors promised delivery, backorder notices or unexpected delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery, and the current expected date of delivery. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1, 2010. The use of best available methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2010. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section, upon request by the owner or operator, the Administrator may provide reasonable extensions of the 45-day period for submission of the revised report or information under paragraphs (h)(1) and (2). If the Administrator receives a request for extension of the 45-day period, by email to an address prescribed by the Administrator prior to the expiration of the 45-day period, the extension request is deemed to be automatically granted for 30 days. The Administrator may grant an additional extension beyond the automatic 30-day extension if the owner or operator submits a request for an additional extension and the request is received by the Administrator prior to the expiration of the automatic 30-day extension, provided the request demonstrates that it is not practicable to submit a revised report or information under paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) within 75 days. The Administrator will approve the extension request if the request demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not practicable to collect and process the data needed to resolve potential reporting errors identified pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) or (2) within 75 days. (6) For units and processes that operate continuously with infrequent outages, it may not be possible to meet the April 1, 2010 deadline for the initial calibration of a flow meter or other measurement device without disrupting normal process operation. In such cases, the owner or operator may postpone the initial calibration until the next scheduled maintenance outage. The best available information from company records may be used in the interim. The subsequent required recalibrations of the flow meters may be similarly postponed. Such postponements shall be documented in the monitoring plan that is required under paragraph (g)(5) of this section. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (3) Timing of request. (i) The initial notice of intent must be submitted no later than January 1, 2011, or by the end of the approved use of best available monitoring methods extension in 2010, whichever is earlier. The completed extension request must be submitted to the Administrator no later than February 15, 2011. (ii) Any subsequent extensions to the original request must be submitted to the Administrator within 4 weeks of the owner or operator identifying the need to extend the request, but in any event no later than 4 weeks before the date for the planned process equipment or unit shutdown that was provided in the original or most recently approved request. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (6) Measurement device installation deadline. Any owner or operator that submits both a timely initial notice of intent and a timely completed extension request under paragraph (j)(3) of this section to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by July 1, 2011 unless the extension request under this paragraph (j) is approved by the Administrator before July 1, 2011. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than January 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be purchased and delivered by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, include supporting documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was ordered, investigation of alternative suppliers and the dates by which alternative vendors promised delivery, backorder notices or unexpected delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery, and the current expected date of delivery. (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process unit shutdown. Include the date of the most recent process unit shutdown, the frequency of shutdowns for this process unit, and the date of the next planned shutdown during which the monitoring equipment can be installed. If there has been a shutdown or if there is a planned process unit shutdown between November 29 of the year during which the change in GWPs is published and April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, include a justification of why the equipment could not be obtained and installed during that shutdown. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (ii) No later than January 1, 2011, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on January 1, 2010, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have not been installed and certified by January 1, 2010. In this case, you may use Tier 2 or Tier 3 to report GHG emissions for 2010. However, if the required CEMS are certified some time in 2010, you need not wait until January 1, 2011 to begin using Tier 4. Rather, you may switch from Tier 2 or Tier 3 to Tier 4 as soon as CEMS certification testing is successfully completed. If this reporting option is chosen, you must document the change in CO<E T=""52"">2 calculation methodology in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5) and in the GHG emissions report under § 98.3(c). Data recorded by the CEMS during a certification test period in 2010 may be used for reporting under this part, provided that the following two conditions are met: (iii) No later than 180 days following the date on which a change is made that triggers Tier 4 applicability under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii) of this section (e.g., a change in the primary fuel, manner of unit operation, or installed continuous monitoring equipment). (iii) The provisions of an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (iii) The use of this reporting option is documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). Indicate in the Monitoring Plan which units share the common fuel supply and the method used to demonstrate that this alternative reporting option applies. For the small combustion sources, a description of the types of units and the approximate number of units is sufficient. (iii) Are not in the Acid Rain Program, but are required to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and heat input data year-round, in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. (3) Within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, you shall submit explanations of the following: (4) Within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, you shall submit the verification data and information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(v), and (e)(2)(vii) of this section. The annual report shall comply with the data reporting requirements specified in § 98.36(d)(1). (ii) You must notify the EPA of your use of a previously approved alternative method in your annual report. (iii) Otherwise, you must submit the request within 45 days following promulgation of this subpart or within the first 30 days of each subsequent reporting year. (iv) If the Administrator does not approve your requested alternative method within 150 days of the end of the reporting year, you must determine the N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for the current reporting period using the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (3) If you requested Administrator approval for an alternative method of determining N<E T=""52"">2O emissions under § 98.53(a)(2), you must conduct the performance test if your request has not been approved by the Administrator within 150 days of the end of the reporting year in which it was submitted. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (n) of this section at the facility level. You must report: In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), you must report the following information at the facility level: (iii) You must use representative data from the previous reporting year to estimate the total uptime of all abatement systems for the stack system as calculated by Equation I–23 of this subpart, instead of using Equation I–15 of this subpart to calculate the average uptime factor. If you were not required to submit an annual report under subpart I for the previous reporting year and data from the previous reporting year are not available, you may estimate the total uptime of all abatement systems for the stack system based on representative operating data from a period of at least 30 days in the current reporting year. (i) Notify the Administrator (or an authorized representative) of your intention to use the results of the previous emissions testing. You must include in the notification the data and results you intend to use for meeting either reporting or recordkeeping requirements, a description of the method, and any deviations from the requirements in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. Your description must include an explanation of how any deviations do not affect the quality of the data collected. (iii) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to disapprove the results of the previous emissions testing, the Administrator may request that you provide additional information to support the use of the results of the previous emissions testing. Failure to respond to any request made by the Administrator does not affect the 120 day deadline specified in paragraph (j)(7)(ii) of this section. (3) You must report the results of stack testing or destruction or removal efficiency determination using the alternative method and procedure specified in the approved alternative test plan. You must include in your report for an alternative stack test method and for an alternative abatement system destruction or removal efficiency determination the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section, including all methods, calculations and data used to determine the fluorinated GHG emission factor or the abatement system destruction or removal efficiency. The Administrator will review the results of the test using the alternative methods and procedure and then approve or deny the use of the results of the alternative test method and procedure no later than 120 days after they are submitted to EPA. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), you must include in each annual report the following information for each electronics manufacturing facility: (y) If your semiconductor manufacturing facility emits more than 40,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e of GHG emissions, based on your most recently submitted annual report (beginning with the 2015 reporting year) as required in paragraph (c) of this section, from the electronics manufacturing processes subject to reporting under this subpart, you must prepare and submit a triennial (every 3 years) technology assessment report to the Administrator (or an authorized representative) that meets the requirements specified in paragraphs (y)(1) through (6) of this section. Any other semiconductor manufacturing facility may voluntarily submit this report to the Administrator. (1) The first report must be submitted with the annual GHG emissions report that is due no later than March 31, 2017, and subsequent reports must be delivered every 3 years no later than March 31 of the year in which it is due. (4) Multiple semiconductor manufacturing facilities may submit a single consolidated 3-year report as long as the facility identifying information in § 98.3(c)(1) and the certification statement in § 98.3(c)(9) is provided for each facility for which the consolidated report is submitted. (6) The Administrator will review the reports within 120 days and will notify you of a determination whether it is necessary to update any default utilization and by-product formation rates and/or destruction or removal efficiency values. If the Administrator determines it is necessary to update default utilization and by-product formation rates and/or destruction or removal efficiency values, you will then have 180 days from the date you receive notice of the determination to execute the data collection and analysis plan described in the report and submit those data to the Administrator. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, as applicable: (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods to estimate 2011 emissions: parameters other than scoping speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods for parameters other than scoping speciations, emission factors, or emission characterizations to estimate emissions that occur between July 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than February 28, 2011. (C) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be obtained, installed, or operated or why the needed measurement service could not be provided before July 1, 2011. The owner or operator must consider all of the data collection and emission calculation options outlined in the rule for a specific emissions source before claiming that a specific safety, technical, logistical, or legal barrier exists. (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be purchased, delivered, or installed before July 1, 2011, include supporting documentation such as the da",The annual average daily throughput of 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day refers to the dehydrator throughput of natural gas for Â§98.233(e).,1,The answer provided does not address the question asked about whether the throughput specified in §98.233(e)(1) is specific to vent throughput or dehydrator throughput.,1,"The answer provided does not address the evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task.

63,"For Equation W-21, Flare Emissions, Do you use ""5"" for Rj (number of carbon atoms) for hydrocarbons with more than 5 carbons?","The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive emissions from the data. The equations provided describe the calculation of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various source categories. The equations include factors such as calibration error, destruction efficiency, fuel-specific default CO2 emission factors, high heat value of the fuel, and facility-specific N2O emission factors. However, the specific calculation of gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations and the need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing are not directly addressed in the text.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (v) Indicate (yes or no) whether reported emissions include emissions from a cogeneration unit located at the facility. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (6) A written explanation, as required under § 98.3(e), if you change emission calculation methodologies during the reporting period. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. Gas to oil ratio (GOR) means the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. Heavy Gas Oils are petroleum distillates with an approximate boiling range from 651 °F to 1,000 °F. Midgrade gasoline has an octane rating greater than or equal to 88 and less than or equal to 90. This definition applies to the midgrade categories of Conventional-Summer, Conventional-Winter, Reformulated-Summer, and Reformulated-Winter. For midgrade categories of RBOB-Summer, RBOB-Winter, CBOB-Summer, and CBOB-Winter, this definition refers to the expected octane rating of the finished gasoline after oxygenate has been added to the RBOB or CBOB. Motor gasoline (finished) means a complex mixture of volatile hydrocarbons, with or without additives, suitably blended to be used in spark ignition engines. Motor gasoline includes conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline, and all types of oxygenated gasoline. Gasoline also has seasonal variations in an effort to control ozone levels. This is achieved by lowering the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of gasoline during the summer driving season. Depending on the region of the country the RVP is lowered to below 9.0 psi or 7.8 psi. The RVP may be further lowered by state regulations. Regular grade gasoline is gasoline having an antiknock index, i.e., octane rating, greater than or equal to 85 and less than 88. This definition applies to the regular grade categories of Conventional-Summer, Conventional-Winter, Reformulated-Summer, and Reformulated-Winter. For regular grade categories of RBOB-Summer, RBOB-Winter, CBOB-Summer, and CBOB-Winter, this definition refers to the expected octane rating of the finished gasoline after oxygenate has been added to the RBOB or CBOB. Reporting year means the calendar year during which the GHG data are required to be collected for purposes of the annual GHG report. For example, reporting year 2014 is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the annual report for reporting year 2014 is submitted to EPA on March 31, 2015. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere.

Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (d) You are not required to report GHG emissions from pilot lights. A pilot light is a small auxiliary flame that ignites the burner of a combustion device when the control valve opens. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (v) The following default density values may be used for fuel oil, in lieu of using the methods in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section: 6.8 lb/gal for No. 1 oil; 7.2 lb/gal for No. 2 oil; 8.1 lb/gal for No. 6 oil. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (G) Finally, add the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the unit. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpar","For hydrocarbon constituents with 5 or more carbon atoms, Rj is 5 as defined in equation W-21.",1,The answer does not address the question at all and provides incorrect information.,1,"The provided context does not contain any information about Equation W-21 or hydrocarbons with more than 5 carbons. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.0784313725,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the answer does not directly address the specific question about Equation W-21 and Rj for hydrocarbons with more than 5 carbons, it provides information about the calculation methods and factors involved in deriving emissions from various source categories.",,,639,,
64,Are flare emissions included in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a)?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emissions from the data. It refers to the use of emission factors and component counts to calculate annual CO2, CH4, and N2O mass emissions under Subpart C. The tables provided, such as Table W-1A, W-1B, W-1C, W-1D, W-1E, and W-2, contain default emission factors, average component counts, and designation of regions, which are essential for the calculation process. The facility is required to operate and maintain CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology and associated requirements for Tier 4 in Subpart C of Part 98 for reporting process CO2 emissions. The Tier 4 Calculation Methodology involves specific procedures and criteria for calculating and reporting emissions, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part.

(iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (B) Identification of the specific rule requirements (by rule subpart, section, and paragraph numbers) for which the instrumentation is needed. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (B) Identification of the specific rule requirements (by rule subpart, section, and paragraph numbers) for which the instrumentation is needed. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (1) Each such submission shall include the following certification statement signed by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative: “I am authorized to make this submission on behalf of the owners and operators of the facility or supplier, as applicable, for which the submission is made. I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined, and am familiar with, the statements and information submitted in this document and all its attachments. Based on my inquiry of those individuals with primary responsibility for obtaining the information, I certify that the statements and information are to the best of my knowledge and belief true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false statements and information or omitting required statements and information, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment.” (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (ii) “I certify that I have all the necessary authority to carry out my duties and responsibilities under 40 CFR part 98 on behalf of the owners and operators of the facility or supplier, as applicable, and that each such owner and operator shall be fully bound by my representations, actions, inactions, or submissions.” (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (iii) For each such individual, a list of the type or types of electronic submissions under paragraph (m)(1) of this section for which authority is delegated to him or her. (4) Any electronic submission covered by the certification in paragraph (m)(2)(v)(A) of this section and made in accordance with a notice of delegation effective under paragraph (m)(3) of this section shall be deemed to be an electronic submission certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or alternate designated representative submitting such notice of delegation. Supplier means a producer, importer, or exporter in any supply category included in Table A–5 to this subpart, as defined by the corresponding subpart of this part. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98. (4) Flares, unless otherwise required by provisions of another subpart of this part to use methodologies in this subpart. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (i) Equation C–2a of this section applies to any type of fuel listed in Table C–1 of the subpart, except for municipal solid waste (MSW). For MSW combustion, use Equation C–2c of this section. (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (A) The use of Tier 1 or 2 is permitted, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii), (b)(1)(v), (b)(1)(viii), and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. (B) The unit meets the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(B) through (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.

Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. Gas to oil ratio (GOR) means the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. Heavy Gas Oils are petroleum distillates with an approximate boiling range from 651 °F to 1,000 °F. Midgrade gasoline has an octane rating greater than or equal to 88 and less than or equal to 90. This definition applies to the midgrade categories of Conventional-Summer, Conventional-Winter, Reformulated-Summer, and Reformulated-Winter. For midgrade categories of RBOB-Summer, RBOB-Winter, CBOB-Summer, and CBOB-Winter, this definition refers to the expected octane rating of the finished gasoline after oxygenate has been added to the RBOB or CBOB. Motor gasoline (finished) means a complex mixture of volatile hydrocarbons, with or without additives, suitably blended to be used in spark ignition engines. Motor gasoline includes conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline, and all types of oxygenated gasoline. Gasoline also has seasonal variations in an effort to control ozone levels. This is achieved by lowering the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of gasoline during the summer driving season. Depending on the region of the country the RVP is lowered to below 9.0 psi or 7.8 psi. The RVP may be further lowered by state regulations. Regular grade gasoline is gasoline having an antiknock index, i.e., octane rating, greater than or equal to 85 and less than 88. This definition applies to the regular grade categories of Conventional-Summer, Conventional-Winter, Reformulated-Summer, and Reformulated-Winter. For regular grade categories of RBOB-Summer, RBOB-Winter, CBOB-Summer, and CBOB-Winter, this definition refers to the expected octane rating of the finished gasoline after oxygenate has been added to the RBOB or CBOB.

(9) Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting means gathering pipelines and other equipment used to collect petroleum and/or natural gas from onshore production gas or oil wells and used to compress, dehydrate, sweeten, or transport the petroleum and/or natural gas to a natural gas processing facility, a natural gas transmission pipeline or to a natural gas distribution pipeline. Gathering and boosting equipment includes, but is not limited to gathering pipelines, separators, compressors, acid gas removal units, dehydrators, pneumatic devices/pumps, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares.

(vii) For oil wells where the gas production rate is not metered and you elect to use Equation W–10A of this section, calculate the average gas production rate (PR<E T=""52"">s,p) using Equation W–12C of this section. If GOR cannot be determined from your available data, then you must use one of the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(A) or (B) of this section to determine GOR.

(B) If well production oil and gas compositions are not available, use default oil and gas compositions in software programs, such as API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that most closely match the well production gas/oil ratio and API gravity and assume all of the CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 in both oil and gas are emitted from the tank. (B) If non-separator equipment liquid and gas compositions are not available, use default liquid and gas compositions in software programs, such as API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that most closely match the non-separator equipment gas/liquid ratio and API gravity and assume all of the CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 in both hydrocarbon liquids and gas are emitted from the tank. (1) Determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) of the hydrocarbon production from oil well(s) tested. Determine the production rate from gas well(s) tested.

Where a person owns or operates more than one gathering and boosting system in a basin (for example, separate gathering lines that are not connected), then all gathering and boosting equipment that the person owns or operates in the basin would be considered one facility. Any gathering and boosting equipment that is associated with a single gathering and boosting system, including leased, rented, or contracted activities, is considered to be under common control of the owner or operator of the gathering and boosting system that contains the pipeline.

NGL fractionators shall estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the product(s) supplied using Equation NN–1 of this section. The annual volume of each NGL product supplied (Fuel<E T=""52"">h) shall include any amount of that NGL supplied in a mixture or blend of two or more products listed in Tables NN–1 and NN–2 of this subpart.

LDCs shall estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the natural gas received at the city gate (including natural gas that is transported by, but not owned by, the reporter) using Equation NN–1 of this section. For each product, use the default value for higher heating value and CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor in Table NN–1 of this subpart. Alternatively, for each product, a reporter-specific higher heating value and CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor may be used, in place of one or both defaults provided they are developed using methods outlined in § 98.404. For each product, you must use the same volume unit throughout the equation. (2) Calculation Methodology 2. NGL fractionators shall estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the product(s) supplied using Equation NN–2 of this section. The annual volume of each NGL product supplied (Fuel<E T=""52"">h) shall include any amount of that NGL supplied in a mixture or blend of two or more products listed in Tables NN–1 and NN–2 of this subpart. The annual volume of each NGL product supplied shall exclude any amount of that NGL contained in bulk NGLs exiting the facility (e.g., y-grade, o-grade, and other bulk NGLs). LDCs shall estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the natural gas received at the city gate (including natural gas that is transported by, but not owned by, the reporter) using Equation NN–2 of this section.

Alternatively, for each product, a reporter-specific CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor may be used in place of the default factor, provided it is developed using methods outlined in § 98.404. For each product, you must use the same volume unit throughout the equation.

(1) For each gas-liquid separator for which flow is measured using a mass flow meter, you must calculate annually the total mass of CO<E T=""52"">2 produced from an oil or other fluid stream in metric tons that is separated from the fluid by multiplying the mass gas flow by the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration in the gas flow, according to Equation RR–7 of this section. You must collect these data quarterly. Mass flow and concentration data measurements must be made in accordance with § 98.444. (2) For each gas-liquid separator for which flow is measured using a volumetric flow meter, you must calculate annually the total mass of CO<E T=""52"">2 produced from an oil or other fluid stream in metric tons that is separated from the fluid by multiplying the volumetric gas flow at standard conditions by the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration in the gas flow and the density of CO<E T=""52"">2 at standard conditions, according to Equation RR–8 of this section.

","Under §98.232(e), emissions from flare stacks are not required to be reported as a separate emission source for onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities.  However, this does not exclude the reporting of flared emissions from the other emission sources listed in §98.232(e) if they are routed to a flare.  The flare source type in §98.233(n) covers only emissions that are not reported in association with any of the other source types in §98.233; see §98.233(n)(10).  For example, if transmission storage tank emissions are going to a flare, then the rule requires the adjustment of transmission storage tank emissions sent to flare per §98.233(k)(4).  The flared transmission storage tank emissions, however, have to be reported as transmission storage tank emissions under §98.236(c)(9).",3,"The answer provides partial relevance to the question by mentioning the sections of the rule that provide information on emissions from flares and the equations for determining CO2 emissions from natural gas combustion.

(4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company.

You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (iii) For a gaseous fuel, use Equation C–5 of this section. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (iv) For units that qualify to use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methods in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(iii) of this section, if both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, separate calculation and reporting of the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) is optional, only for the 2010 reporting year, as provided in § 98.3(c)(12). (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation. (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). (ii) Determine the relative proportions of biogenic and non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in the flue gas on a quarterly basis using the method specified in § 98.34(d) (for units that combust MSW as the primary fuel or as the only fuel with a biogenic component) or in § 98.34(e) (for other units, including units that combust tires). (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (3) Special considerations for blending of fuels. In situations where different types of fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (for example, different ranks of coal or different grades of fuel oil) are in the same state of matter (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas), and are blended prior to combustion, use the following procedures to determine the appropriate CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor and HHV for the blend. (i) If the fuels to be blended are received separately, and if the quantity (mass or volume) of each fuel is measured before the fuels are mixed and combusted, then, for each component of the blend, calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately. Substitute into Equation C–2a of this subpart the total measured mass or volume of the component fuel (from company records), together with the appropriate default CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor from Table C–1, and the annual average HHV, calculated according to § 98.33(a)(2)(ii). In this case, the fact that the fuels are blended prior to combustion is of no consequence. (ii) If the fuel is received as a blend (i.e., already mixed) or if the components are mixed on site without precisely measuring the mass or volume of each one individually, a reasonable estimate of the relative proportions of the components of the blend must be made, using the best available information (e.g., the approximate annual average mass or volume percentage of each fuel, based on the typical or expected range of values). Determine the appropriate CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor and HHV for use in Equation C–2a of this subpart, as follows: (iv) If the fuel blend described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section consists of a mixture of fuel(s) listed in Table C–1 of this subpart and one or more fuels not listed in Table C–1, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 and other GHG emissions only for the Table C–1 fuel(s), using the best available estimate of the mass or volume percentage(s) of the Table C–1 fuel(s) in the blend. In this case, Tier 1 shall be used, with the following modifications to Equations C–17 and C–1, to account for the fact that not all of the fuels in the blend are listed in Table C–1: (4) If, for a particular type of fuel, HHV sampling and analysis is performed more often than the minimum frequency specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the results of all valid fuel analyses shall be used in the GHG emission calculations. (iii) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the initial and ongoing calibration requirements of this paragraph and from the Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping requirements of §§ 98.3(g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7), provided that the fuel supplier and the unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are only used for unit startup are also exempted from the initial and ongoing calibration requirements of this paragraph. (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (iii) If, for a particular type of fuel, sampling and analysis for carbon content and molecular weight is performed more often than the minimum frequency specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the results of all valid fuel analyses shall be used in the GHG emission calculations. (6) Biogenic fuel consumption and high heating value, as applicable, under §§ 98.33(e)(5) and (e)(6). (7) Fuel usage for CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions calculations under § 98.33(c)(4)(ii). (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (ii) On an annual basis, at least 95 percent (by mass or volume) of the shared fuel is combusted in the large combustion unit(s), and the remainder is combusted in the small combustion sources. Company records may be used to determine the percentage distribution of the shared fuel to the large and small units; and (A) The results of each quarterly sample analysis, expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., if the biogenic fraction of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from MSW combustion is 30 percent, report 0.30). (xi) When ASTM methods D7459–08 and D6866–16 (both incorporated by reference, see § 98.7) are used in accordance with § 98.34(e) to determine the biogenic portion of the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from a unit that co-fires biogenic fuels (or partly-biogenic fuels, including tires if you are electing to report biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from tire combustion) and non-biogenic fuels, you shall report the results of each quarterly sample analysis, expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., if the biogenic fraction of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions is 30 percent, report 0.30). (4) Annual natural gas usage (therms/year) (Equation C–1a of § 98.33). (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). (7) Volume of each liquid fuel combusted (gallons/year) (Equation C–2a). (19) Annual volume of each liquid fuel combusted (gallons/year) (Equation C–4 of § 98.33). (31) Total quantity of each liquid fossil fuel combusted in the reporting year, as defined in § 98.6 (gallons) (Equation C–13). (3) If you manufacture PVs, you must calculate annual production process emissions of each input gas i for threshold applicability purposes using gas-appropriate GWP values shown in Table A–1 to subpart A of this part and Equation I–3 of this subpart. (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (e) You must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed, on a fab basis, for each process sub-type or process type j, using Equation I–13 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–13 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). If you elect to calculate emissions using the stack test method in paragraph (i) of this section, you must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed on the applicable basis by using an appropriate apportioning factor. For example, when calculating fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG consumed using Equation I–21 of this section, you must substitute the term fij with the appropriate apportioning factor to calculate the total consumption of each fluorinated GHG in tools that are vented to stack systems that are tested. (g) If you report controlled emissions pursuant to § 98.94(f), you must calculate the uptime of all the abatement systems for each combination of input gas or by-product gas, and process sub-type or process type, by using Equation I–15 of this subpart. (i) When you are calculating preliminary estimates for the purpose of this paragraph (i)(1), you must consider the subscript “j” in Equations I–8 and I–9, and I–13 of this subpart to mean “stack system” instead of “process sub-type or process type.” For the value of a<E T=""52"">ij, the fraction of input gas i that is used in tools with abatement systems, for use in Equations I–8 and I–9, you may use the ratio of the number of tools using input gas i that have abatement systems that are vented to the stack system for which you are calculating the preliminary estimate to the total number of tools using input gas i that are vented to that stack system, expressed as a decimal fraction. In calculating the preliminary estimates, you must account for the effect of any fluorinated GHG abatement system meeting the definition of abatement system in § 98.98. You may use this approach to determining a<E T=""52"">ij only for this preliminary estimate. (ii) You must use representative data from the previous reporting year to estimate the consumption of input gas i as calculated in Equation I–13 of this subpart and the fraction of input gas i and by-product gas k destroyed in abatement systems for each stack system as calculated by Equations I–24A and I–24B of this subpart. If you were not required to submit an annual report under subpart I for the previous reporting year and data from the previous reporting year are not available, you may estimate the consumption of input gas i and the fraction of input gas i destroyed in abatement systems based on representative operating data from a period of at least 30 days in the current reporting year. When calculating the consumption of input gas i using Equation I–13 of this subpart, the term “f<E T=""52"">ij” is replaced with the ratio of the number of tools using input gas i that are vented to the stack system for which you are calculating the preliminary estimate to the total number of tools in the fab using input gas i, expressed as a decimal fraction. You may use this approach to determining f<E T=""52"">ij only for this preliminary estimate. (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account for the anticipated change in your preliminary estimate. You may account for such a change using a quantifiable metric (e.g., the ratio of the number of tools that are expected to be vented to the stack system in the current year as compared to the previous reporting year, ratio of the expected number of wafer starts in the current reporting year as compared to the previous reporting year), engineering judgment, or other industry standard practice. (iii) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG input gas consumed (in kg of fluorinated GHG emitted per kg of input gas i consumed) in the tools that vent to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–19 of this subpart. If the emissions of input gas i exceed the consumption of input gas i during the sampling period, then equate “E<E T=""52"">is” to the consumption of input gas i and treat the difference between the emissions and consumption of input gas i as a by-product of the other input gases, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. (viii) When using the stack testing option described in paragraph (i) of this section, you must calculate the weighted-average fraction of each fluorinated input gas i and each fluorinated byproduct gas k destroyed or removed in abatement systems for each fab f, as applicable, by using Equation I–24A (for input gases) and Equation I–24B (for by-product gases) of this subpart. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (1) Base your fab-wide gas-specific heel factors on the trigger point for change out of a container for each container size and type for each gas used. Fab-wide gas-specific heel factors must be expressed as the ratio of the trigger point for change out, in terms of mass, to the initial mass in the container, as determined by paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. (2) The trigger points for change out you use to calculate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your containers. If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas. (3) The initial mass you use to calculate a fab-wide gas-specific heel factor in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be based on the weight of the gas provided to you in gas supplier documents; however, you remain responsible for the accuracy of these masses and weights under this subpart. (i) For containers with a maximum storage capacity of less than 9.08 kg (20 lbs) of gas, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 50 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type. (ii) For all other containers, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 20 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type. (5) You must re-calculate a fab-wide gas-specific heel factor if you execute a process change to modify the trigger point for change out for a gas and container type that differs by more than 5 percent from the previously used trigger point for change out for that gas and container type. (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (1) You must demonstrate that the fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O apportioning factors are developed using calculations that are repeatable, as defined in § 98.98. (i) You must analyze actual and modeled gas consumption for a period when the fab is at a representative operating level (as defined in § 98.98) lasting at least 30 days but no more than the reporting year. (ii) You must compare the actual gas consumed to the modeled gas consumed for one fluorinated GHG reported under this subpart for the fab. You must certify that the fluorinated GHG selected for comparison corresponds to the largest quantity, on a mass basis, of fluorinated GHG consumed at the fab during the reporting year for which you are required to apportion following the procedures specified in § 98.93(a), (b), or (i). You may compare the actual gas consumed to the modeled gas consumed for two fluorinated GHGs and demonstrate conformance according to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section on an aggregate use basis for both fluorinated GHGs if one of the fluorinated GHGs selected for comparison corresponds to the largest quantity, on a mass basis, of fluorinated GHGs used at each fab that requires apportionment during the reporting year. (iii) You must demonstrate that the comparison performed for the largest quantity of gas(es), on a mass basis, consumed in the fab in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, does not result in a difference between the actual and modeled gas consumption that exceeds 20 percent relative to actual gas consumption, reported to two significant figures using standard rounding conventions. (iv) If you are required to apportion gas consumption and you use the procedures in § 98.93(i) to calculate annual emissions from a fab, you must verify your apportioning factors using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section such that the time period specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and the last day you perform the sampling events specified under § 98.93(i)(3) occur in the same accounting month. (3) As an alternative to developing apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption using a fab-specific engineering model, you may develop apportioning factors through the use of direct measurement using gas flow meters and weigh scales to measure process sub-type, process type, stack system, or fab-specific input gas consumption. You may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a fab-specific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5). (f) If your fab employs abatement systems and you elect to reflect emission reductions due to these systems, or if your fab employs abatement systems designed for fluorinated GHG abatement and you elect to calculate fluorinated GHG emissions using the stack test method under § 98.93(i), you must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section. If you use an average of properly measured destruction or removal efficiencies for a gas and process sub-type or process type combination, as applicable, in your emission calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), you must also adhere to procedures in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. (A) For the first 2 years for which your fab is required to report emissions of fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O, for each abatement system gas and process sub-type or process type combination, as applicable, a random sample of a minimum of 10 percent of installed abatement systems must be tested annually for a total of a minimum of 20 percent, or a minimum of 20 percent may be tested in the first year. For every 3-year period following the initial 2-year period, a random sample of at least 15 percent of installed abatement systems must be tested for each gas and process sub-type or process type combination; you may test 15-percent in the first year of the 3-year period, but you must test at least 5 percent each year until 15 percent are tested. For each 3-year period, you must determine the number of abatement systems to be tested based on the average number of abatement systems in service over the 3-year period. If the required percent of the total number of abatement systems to be tested for each gas and process sub-type or process type combination does not equate to a whole number, the number of systems to be tested must be determined by rounding up to the nearest integer. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section, you may not retest an abatement system for any gas and process sub-type or process type combination, as applicable, until all of the abatement systems for that gas and process sub-type or process type combination have been tested. (h) You must adhere to the QA/QC procedures of this paragraph (h) when calculating annual gas consumption for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O used at each fab and emissions from the use of each fluorinated heat transfer fluid on a fab basis. (iii) If a fluorinated GHG being consumed in the reporting year was not being consumed during the stack testing and does not meet the definition of intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG in § 98.98, then you must test the stack systems associated with the use of that fluorinated GHG at a time when that gas is in use at a magnitude that would allow you to determine an emission factor for that gas. If a fluorinated GHG consumed in the reporting year was not being consumed during the stack testing and is no longer in use by your fab (e.g., use of the gas has become obsolete or has been discontinued), then you must calculate annual emissions for that fluorinated GHG according to the procedure specified in § 98.93(i)(4). (B) The relative standard deviation for all single fluorinated GHGs that individually accounted for 5 percent or more of CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions were less than 20 percent. (i) Annual consumption of a fluorinated GHG used during the most recent emissions test (expressed in CO<E T=""52"">2e) changes by more than 10 percent of the total annual fluorinated GHG consumption, relative to gas consumption in CO<E T=""52"">2e for that gas during the year of the most recent emissions test (for example, if the use of a single gas goes from 25 percent of CO<E T=""52"">2e to greater than 35 percent of CO<E T=""52"">2e, this change would trigger a re-test). (5) When you use the","40 CFR § 98.238 defines a flare as “…a combustion device, whether at ground level or elevated, that uses an open or closed flame to combust waste gases without energy recovery.”  An open pipe without combustion would not be considered a flare, but any hydrocarbon releases through it would be considered “vented emissions” under §98.238, which includes “process designed flow to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes.”",,,,,1,0.0406504065,,,,,3256,,
67,"Under Subpart W, under both the onshore production and gas processing source categories, are we required to report emissions from all flares at the gas processing facility or on or associated with a well pad, including emergency flares?","The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive emissions from the data. It outlines the calculation methodologies for deriving GHG emissions from various source categories, including stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part). The document also specifies the conditions under which facilities can discontinue complying with the reporting requirements based on their emissions levels. However, specific information about whether facilities covered by the Subpart W Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting industry segment can use Subpart C emission factors for calculating combustion emissions is not explicitly mentioned in the provided input.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. For these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the subparts listed in Table A–5 of this subpart. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (xi) Injection of Carbon Dioxide (subpart UU). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part.

Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (i) Total quantity of GHG aggregated for all GHG from all applicable supply categories in Table A–5 of this subpart and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. (ii) Quantity of each GHG from each applicable supply category in Table A–5 to this subpart, expressed in metric tons of each GHG. For each reported fluorinated GHG, report the following identifying information: (6) A written explanation, as required under § 98.3(e), if you change emission calculation methodologies during the reporting period. (8) Each parameter for which a missing data procedure was used according to the procedures of an applicable subpart and the total number of hours in the year that a missing data procedure was used for each parameter. Parameters include not only reported data elements, but any data element required for monitoring and calculating emissions. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart.

During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used.

The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data from each measurement device shall be documented in the written monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (4) A change in the GWP for one or more compounds includes the addition to Table A–1 of this subpart of either a chemical-specific or a default GWP that applies to a compound to which no chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart previously applied. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 means carbon dioxide emissions generated as the result of biomass combustion from combustion units for which emission calculations are required by an applicable part 98 subpart. Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Destruction device, for the purposes of subparts II and TT of this part, means a flare, thermal oxidizer, boiler, turbine, internal combustion engine, or any other combustion unit used to destroy or oxidize methane contained in landfill gas or wastewater biogas. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment.

(1) Oil and Gas Field Code Master List 2008, DOE/EIA0370(08), January 2009, IBR approved for § 98.238. Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part.

(2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in ","Yes, emergency flares are covered under the general category of flares.  For reporting purposes, in the final rule, EPA reduced the burden associated with the flare monitoring and reporting requirements by allowing the use of engineering calculations based on process knowledge, company records, and best available data for estimating flow volumes and gas compositions.",1,"The answer does not address the question about reporting emissions from flares at gas processing facilities or well pads under Subpart W. Instead, it provides general information about calculation methodologies and discontinuing reporting based on emissions levels.",1,"The answer does not provide a clear and direct response to the question asked.

68,,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emission from the data. The equation describes E = COUNT * EF, where E represents the emissions, COUNT is the number of units, and EF is the emission factor. This equation is used to calculate the emissions from processing plants that do not fractionate but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. The text does not explicitly specify whether this is based on annual average daily flow or max design capacity, but based on the provided information, it can be inferred that the calculation is based on the annual average throughput.","(ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (13) An indication of whether the facility includes one or more plant sites that have been assigned a “plant code” (as defined under § 98.6) by either the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration or by the EPA's Clean Air Markets Division. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Maximum rated heat input capacity means the hourly heat input to a unit (in mmBtu/hr), when it combusts the maximum amount of fuel per hour that it is capable of combusting on a steady state basis, as of the initial installation of the unit, as specified by the manufacturer. Maximum rated input capacity means the maximum charging rate of a municipal waste combustor unit expressed in tons per day of municipal solid waste combusted, calculated according to the procedures under 40 CFR 60.58b(j). Municipal wastewater treatment plant means a series of treatment processes used to remove contaminants and pollutants from domestic, business, and industrial wastewater collected in city sewers and transported to a centralized wastewater treatment system such as a publicly owned treatment works (POTW). Plant code means either of the following: Process unit means the equipment assembled and connected by pipes and ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture either a final product or an intermediate used in the onsite production of other products. The process unit also includes the purification of recovered byproducts. Sulfur recovery plant means all process units which recover sulfur or produce sulfuric acid from hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S) and/or sulfur dioxide (SO<E T=""52"">2) from a common source of sour gas at a petroleum refinery. The sulfur recovery plant also includes sulfur pits used to store the recovered sulfur product, but it does not include secondary sulfur storage vessels or loading facilities downstream of the sulfur pits. For example, a Claus sulfur recovery plant includes: Reactor furnace and waste heat boiler, catalytic reactors, sulfur pits, and, if present, oxidation or reduction control systems, or incinerator, thermal oxidizer, or similar combustion device. Multiple sulfur recovery units are a single sulfur recovery plant only when the units share the same source of sour gas. Sulfur recovery units that receive source gas from completely segregated sour gas treatment systems are separate sulfur recovery plants. (44) ASTM D5614–94 (Reapproved 2008) Standard Test Method for Open Channel Flow Measurement of Water with Broad-Crested Weirs, approved October 1, 2008, IBR approved for § 98.354(d). (3) Irrigation pumps at agricultural operations. (A) If the results of fuel sampling are received monthly or more frequently, then for each unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than or equal to 100 mmBtu/hr (or for a group of units that includes at least one unit of that size), the annual average HHV shall be calculated using Equation C–2b of this section. If multiple HHV determinations are made in any month, average the values for the month arithmetically. (B) If the results of fuel sampling are received less frequently than monthly, or, for a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity less than 100 mmBtu/hr (or a group of such units) regardless of the HHV sampling frequency, the annual average HHV shall either be computed according to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section or as the arithmetic average HHV for all values for the year (including valid samples and substitute data values under § 98.35). (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (iii) Cumulative maximum rated heat input capacity of the group (mmBtu/hr). The cumulative maximum rated heat input capacity shall be determined as the sum of the maximum rated heat input capacities for all units in the group, excluding units less than 10 (mmBtu/hr). (ii) Cumulative maximum rated heat input capacity of the units served by the common pipe (mmBtu/hr). The cumulative maximum rated heat input capacity shall be determined as the sum of the maximum rated heat input capacities for all units served by the common pipe, excluding units less than 10 (mmBtu/hr). (iii) The highest maximum rated heat input capacity of any unit served by the common pipe (mmBtu/hr). (2) Existing plant procedures used for accounting purposes. (5) Volumetric flow rate per test run during performance test (dscf/hr). (2) Annual facility cement production. (b) You must calculate annual manufacturing capacity of a facility using Equation I–5 of this subpart. (2) Generically-identified process. For each production and transformation process at the facility, you must: (1) Where the mass flow of the combined stream of HFC–23 and another reaction product (e.g., HCl) is measured, multiply the weekly (or more frequent) HFC–23 concentration measurement (which may be the average of more frequent concentration measurements) by the weekly (or more frequent) mass flow of the combined stream of HFC–23 and the other product. To estimate annual HFC–23 production, sum the weekly (or more frequent) estimates of the quantities of HFC–23 produced over the year. This calculation is summarized in Equation O–1 of this section: (2) Annual lead product production capacity (tons). (a) Lime manufacturing plants (LMPs) engage in the manufacture of a lime product by calcination of limestone, dolomite, shells or other calcareous substances as defined in 40 CFR 63.7081(a)(1). (15) Annual lime production capacity (tons) per facility. The magnesium production and processing source category consists of the following processes: (b) Types of production processes at the facility (e.g., primary, secondary, die casting). (3) Onshore natural gas processing. Natural gas processing means the separation of natural gas liquids (NGLs) or non-methane gases from produced natural gas, or the separation of NGLs into one or more component mixtures. Separation includes one or more of the following: forced extraction of natural gas liquids, sulfur and carbon dioxide removal, fractionation of NGLs, or the capture of CO<E T=""52"">2 separated from natural gas streams. This segment also includes all residue gas compression equipment owned or operated by the natural gas processing plant. This industry segment includes processing plants that fractionate gas liquids, and processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. (8) For Calculation Method 3, determine annual average volumetric fraction of CO<E T=""52"">2 content in natural gas flowing out of the AGR unit using one of the methods specified in paragraphs (d)(8)(i) through (d)(8)(iii) of this section. (1) Calculation Method 1. Calculate annual mass emissions from glycol dehydrators that have an annual average of daily natural gas throughput that is greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day by using a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS® or GRI–GLYCalc TM, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state to calculate the equilibrium coefficient, speciates CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from dehydrators, and has provisions to include regenerator control devices, a separator flash tank, stripping gas and a gas injection pump or gas assist pump. The following parameters must be determined by engineering estimate based on best available data and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from dehydrators: (2) Calculation Method 2. Calculate annual volumetric emissions from glycol dehydrators that have an annual average of daily natural gas throughput that is less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day using Equation W–5 of this section: (i) Determine the well vent average flow rate (“FR” in Equation W–7A of this section) as specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section for at least one well in a unique well tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in each sub-basin category. Calculate emissions from wells with plunger lifts and wells without plunger lifts separately. (A) Calculate the average flow rate per hour of venting for each unique tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in each sub-basin category by dividing the recorded total annual flow by the recorded time (in hours) for all measured liquid unloading events with venting to the atmosphere. (B) Apply the average hourly flow rate calculated under paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) of this section to all wells in the same pressure group that have the same tubing diameter group, for the number of hours of venting these wells.

(2) Average estimated number of hours in the calendar year the pumps were operational (“T” in Equation W–2 of this subpart). (ii) Total feed rate entering the acid gas removal unit, using a meter or engineering estimate based on process knowledge or best available data, in million cubic feet per year. (D) The natural gas flow rate used, as specified in Equation W–4A of this subpart, reported as either total annual volume of natural gas flow into the acid gas removal unit in cubic feet at actual conditions; or total annual volume of natural gas flow out of the acid gas removal unit, as specified in Equation W–4B of this subpart, in cubic feet at actual conditions. (e) Dehydrators. You must indicate whether your facility contains any of the following equipment: Glycol dehydrators with an annual average daily natural gas throughput greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, glycol dehydrators with an annual average daily natural gas throughput less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, and dehydrators that use desiccant. If your facility contains any of the equipment listed in this paragraph (e), then you must report the applicable information in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3).

(E) Average flow rate of the well venting over the duration of the liquids unloading, in standard cubic feet per hour. (E) Average flow rate of the well venting over the duration of the liquids unloading, in standard cubic feet per hour. (ii) For the measured well(s), the flowback rate, in standard cubic feet per hour (average of “FR<E T=""52"">s,p” values used in Equation W–12A of § 98.233), and the well ID numbers of the wells for which it is measured. You may delay the reporting of this data element if you indicate in the annual report that wildcat wells and/or delineation wells are the only wells that can be used for the measurement. If you elect to delay reporting of this data element, you must report by the date specified in § 98.236(cc) the measured flowback rate during well completion or workover and the well ID number(s) for the well(s) included in the measurement.

70,,"Under onshore natural gas processing, vent emissions are reported as part of the mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for facilities that directly emit GHG. The emissions are calculated using specific methodologies and equations as described in the document. The document contains several relevant tables such as Table W-1A, Table W-1B, Table W-1C, Table W-1D, Table W-1E, and Table W-2. These tables provide emission factors, component counts, and designation of regions for reporting purposes related to onshore natural gas processing. Specifically, Table W-2 titled 'Default Total Hydrocarbon Emission Factors for Onshore Natural Gas Processing' presents emission factors for onshore natural gas processing plants, which are used in the calculation of vent emissions. The document does not provide specific equations, but it indicates that the emissions are calculated using specific methodologies and equations, which are likely detailed in the document's content.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart.

The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions.

Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (3) The annual GHG reports. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere.

(4) Emissions Inventory Improvement Program, Volume II: Chapter 16, Methods for Estimating Air Emissions from Chemical Manufacturing Facilities, August 2007, Final, http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/eiip/techreport/volume02/index.html, IBR approved for § 98.123(c)(1)(i)(A). Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (A) At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if necessary) Method 4 in appendices A–2 and A–3 to part 60 of this chapter to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 3A tests are required, to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration. A Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate (e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded during the test. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (G) Finally, add the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the unit. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (B) Sum the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions values over the entire reporting year to obtain the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons. (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons. (E) The installed CEMS include a gas monitor of any kind or a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, or both and the monitors have been certified, either in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met. (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (ii) No later than January 1, 2011, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on January 1, 2010, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have not been installed and certified by January 1, 2010. In this case, you may use Tier 2 or Tier 3 to report GHG emissions for 2010. However, if the required CEMS are certified some time in 2010, you need not wait until January 1, 2011 to begin using Tier 4. Rather, you may switch from Tier 2 or Tier 3 to Tier 4 as soon as CEMS certification testing is successfully completed. If this reporting option is chosen, you must document the change in CO<E T=""52"">2 calculation methodology in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5) and in the GHG emissions report under § 98.3(c). Data recorded by the CEMS during a certification test period in 2010 may be used for reporting under this part, provided that the following two conditions are met: (c) Calculation of CH<E T=""54"">4 and N<E T=""54"">2O emissions from stationary combustion sources. You must calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions only for units that are required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the calculation methodologies of this subpart and for only those fuels that are listed in Table C–2 of this subpart. (i) If only one type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart is combusted during the reporting year, substitute the cumulative annual heat input from combustion of the fuel into Equation C–10 of this section to calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 or N<E T=""52"">2O emissions. For units in the Acid Rain Program and units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, obtain the cumulative annual heat input directly from the electronic data reports required under § 75.64 of this chapter. For Tier 4 units, use the best available information, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate the cumulative annual heat input (HI)<E T=""52"">A. (5) When multiple fuels are combusted during the reporting year, sum the fuel-specific results from Equations C–8, C–8a, C–8b, C–9a, C–9b, or C–10 of this section (as applicable) to obtain the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions, in metric tons. (D) Sum the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions across all component fuels to obtain the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions for the blend. Similarly sum the annual N<E T=""52"">2O emissions across all component fuels to obtain the annual N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for the blend. Report these annual emissions totals. (2) The total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions reported for the unit shall include the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion process and the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the sorbent. (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). (ii) Sum all of the hourly V<E T=""52"">CO2h values for the reporting year, to obtain V<E T=""52"">total, the total annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted. (iii) Calculate the annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion using Equation C–13 of this section. If two or more types of fossil fuel are combusted during the year, perform a separate calculation with Equation C–13 of this section for each fuel and sum the results. (vi) Calculate the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in metric tons, by multiplying the results obtained from Equation C–14 of this section by the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in metric tons, as determined: (C) From the electronic data report required under § 75.64 of this chapter, for units in the Acid Rain Program and other units using CEMS to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions according to part 75 of this chapter. However, before calculating the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, multiply the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by 0.91 to convert from short tons to metric tons. (iv) If the combustion of MSW and/or tires provides no more than 10 percent of the annual heat input to a unit, or if a small, batch incinerator combusts no more than 1,000 tons per year of MSW, you may estimate the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions as follows, in lieu of following the procedures in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section: The CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data for stationary fuel combustion sources shall be monitored as follows: (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For th",,,,1,"The answer does not follow logically from the information contained in the context. The context discusses mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirements for facilities that directly emit GHG, including onshore petroleum and natural gas production, but does not mention vent emissions related to onshore natural gas processing.",1,0.0,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides relevant information about the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirements for onshore natural gas processing facilities. It mentions the use of specific methodologies and equations for calculating vent emissions and refers to relevant tables in the document. However, the answer could be more coherent and organized.",985,,
71,,"The provided text does not contain specific information about the design or actual capacity of a processing plant in relation to 98.230(a)(3) or 25 mmscf per day. The text mainly focuses on reporting requirements, monitoring methods, and record-keeping for various environmental parameters and calculations. The equations and tables in the text are related to environmental emissions factors, conversion factors, and process-specific parameters, but they do not directly address the specific capacity of a processing plant. Therefore, based on the given input, it is not possible to determine whether 25 mmscf per day represents the design capacity or the actual capacity of a processing plant.","(h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (j) Table A–2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d).

This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98. (1) Portable equipment, as defined in § 98.6. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5).

(i) §§ 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. (iii) The provisions of an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (f) The records required under § 98.3(g)(2)(i) shall include an explanation of how the following parameters are determined from company records (or, if applicable, from the best available information): (4) Sorbent usage, when § 98.33(d) applies. (5) Quantity of steam generated by a unit when § 98.33(a)(2)(iii) applies. (6) Biogenic fuel consumption and high heating value, as applicable, under §§ 98.33(e)(5) and (e)(6). (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (11) If applicable, the plant code (as defined in § 98.6). (ii) For units that use the alternative methods specified in § 98.33(a)(5)(i) and (ii) to monitor and report heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter or § 75.19 of this chapter: (J) If applicable, the plant code (as defined in § 98.6).

(iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (13) An indication of whether the facility includes one or more plant sites that have been assigned a “plant code” (as defined under § 98.6) by either the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration or by the EPA's Clean Air Markets Division. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process unit shutdown. Include the date of the most recent process unit shutdown, the frequency of shutdowns for this process unit, and the date of the next planned shutdown during which the monitoring equipment can be installed. If there has been a shutdown or if there is a planned process unit shutdown between November 29 of the year during which the change in GWPs is published and April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, include a justification of why the equipment could not be obtained and installed during that shutdown. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Sulfur recovery plant means all process units which recover sulfur or produce sulfuric acid from hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S) and/or sulfur dioxide (SO<E T=""52"">2) from a common source of sour gas at a petroleum refinery. The sulfur recovery plant also includes sulfur pits used to store the recovered sulfur product, but it does not include secondary sulfur storage vessels or loading facilities downstream of the sulfur pits. For example, a Claus sulfur recovery plant includes: Reactor furnace and waste heat boiler, catalytic reactors, sulfur pits, and, if present, oxidation or reduction control systems, or incinerator, thermal oxidizer, or similar combustion device. Multiple sulfur recovery units are a single sulfur recovery plant only when the units share the same source of sour gas. Sulfur recovery units that receive source gas from completely segregated sour gas treatment systems are separate sulfur recovery plants. Supplemental fuel means a fuel burned within a petrochemical process that is not produced within the process itself. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (f) The following material is available for purchase from the Gas Processors Association (GPA), 6526 East 60th Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74143, (918) 493–3872, http://www.gasprocessors.com. (14) AP 42, Section 7.1, Organic Liquid Storage Tanks, November 2006 (AP 42, Section 7.1), http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/ch07/final/c07s01.pdf; in Chapter 7, Liquid Storage Tanks, of AP 42, Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, 5th Edition, Volume I, IBR approved for § 98.253(m)(1) and § 98.256(o)(2)(i). You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met. (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (1) Aggregation of units. If a facility contains two or more units (e.g., boilers or combustion turbines), each of which has a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less, you may report the combined GHG emissions for the group of units in lieu of reporting GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the use of Tier 4 is not required or elected for any of the units and the units use the same tier for any common fuels combusted. If this option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (2) Monitored common stack or duct configurations. When the flue gases from two or more stationary fuel combustion units at a facility are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere and if CEMS are used to continuously monitor CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions at the common stack or duct according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, you may report the combined emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units. This monitoring and reporting alternative may also be used when process off-gases or a mixture of combustion products and process gases are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere. Whenever the common stack or duct monitoring option is applied, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (f) Each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) subject to reporting under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section must indicate if both of the following two conditions are met: (1) The stationary fuel combustion source contains at least one combustion unit connected to a fuel-fired electric generator owned or operated by an entity that is subject to regulation of customer billing rates by the public utility commission (excluding generators that are connected to combustion units that are subject to subpart D of this part). (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (i) You must determine the amount of process N<E T=""52"">2O emissions that is sold or transferred off site (if applicable). You can determine the amount using existing process flow meters and N<E T=""52"">2O analyzers. (g) If process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from anode consumption during electrolysis or anode baking of prebake cells are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall not be used to calculate those process emissions. The owner or operation shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). (a) Ammonia manufacturing processes in which ammonia is manufactured from a fossil-based feedstock produced via steam reforming of a hydrocarbon. (b) Ammonia manufacturing processes in which ammonia is manufactured through the gasification of solid and liquid raw material. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains an ammonia manufacturing process and the facility meets the requirements of either § 98.2(a)(1) or (2). (a) CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from steam reforming of a hydrocarbon or the gasification of solid and liquid raw material, reported for each ammonia manufacturing process unit following the requirements of this subpart (CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions reported under this subpart may include CO<E T=""52"">2 that is later consumed on site for urea production, and therefore is not released to the ambient air from the ammonia manufacturing process unit). (b) CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit. You must report these emissions under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), by following the requirements of subpart C, except that for ammonia manufacturing processes subpart C does not apply to any CO<E T=""52"">2 resulting from combustion of the waste recycle stream (commonly referred to as the purge gas stream). (1) Gaseous feedstock. You must calculate, from each ammonia manufacturing unit, the CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from gaseous feedstock according to Equation G–1 of this section: (2) Liquid feedstock. You must calculate, from each ammonia manufacturing unit, the CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from liquid feedstock according to Equation G–2 of this section: (4) You must calculate the annual process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from each ammonia processing unit k at your facility according to Equation G–4 of this section: (5) You must determine the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from all ammonia processing units at your facility using Equation G–5 of this section. (c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (1) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions (metric tons) for each ammonia manufacturing process unit. (13) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions (metric tons) from the steam reforming of a hydrocarbon or the gasification of solid and liquid raw material at the ammonia manufacturing process unit used to produce urea and the method used to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 consumed in urea production. (2) Annual facility cement production. (3) Annual cement production at the facility. (g) If you report controlled emissions pursuant to § 98.94(f), you must calculate the uptime of all the abatement systems for each combination of input gas or by-product gas, and process sub-type or process type, by using Equation I–15 of this subpart. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (i) For containers with a maximum storage capacity of less than 9.08 kg (20 lbs) of gas, an excep",,3,"The answer partially addresses the main aspect of the question by mentioning the GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for facilities containing stationary fuel combustion sources.

(iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be purchased and delivered by April 1, 2010, include supporting documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was ordered, investigation of alternative suppliers and the dates by which alternative vendors promised delivery, backorder notices or unexpected delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery, and the current expected date of delivery. (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process unit shutdown. Include the date of the most recent process unit shutdown, the frequency of shutdowns for this process unit, and the date of the next planned shutdown during which the monitoring equipment can be installed. If there has been a shutdown or if there is a planned process unit shutdown between promulgation of this part and April 1, 2010, include a justification of why the equipment could not be obtained and installed during that shutdown. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1, 2010. The use of best available methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2010. (4) Missing data computations. For each missing data event, also retain a record of the cause of the event and the corrective actions taken to restore malfunctioning monitoring equipment. (C) Description of the procedures and methods that are used for quality assurance, maintenance, and repair of all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (iii) The owner or operator shall revise the GHG Monitoring Plan as needed to reflect changes in production processes, monitoring instrumentation, and quality assurance procedures; or to improve procedures for the maintenance and repair of monitoring systems to reduce the frequency of monitoring equipment downtime. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (3) For orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters, the initial quality assurance consists of in-situ calibration of the differential pressure (delta-P), total pressure, and temperature transmitters. (ii) In cases where there are only two transmitters (i.e., differential pressure and either temperature or total pressure) in the immediate vicinity of the flow meter's primary element (e.g., the orifice plate), or when there is only a differential pressure transmitter in close proximity to the primary element, calibration of these existing transmitters to a CE of 2.0 percent or less at each measurement point is still required, in accordance with paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section; alternatively, when two transmitters are calibrated, the results are acceptable if the sum of the CE values for the two transmitters at each calibration level does not exceed 4.0 percent. However, note that installation and calibration of an additional transmitter (or transmitters) at the flow monitor location to measure temperature or total pressure or both is not required in these cases. Instead, you may use assumed values for temperature and/or total pressure, based on measurements of these parameters at a remote location (or locations), provided that the following conditions are met: (E) You shall periodically check the correlation(s) between the remote and actual readings (at least once a year), and make any necessary adjustments to the mathematical relationship(s). (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (6) For units and processes that operate continuously with infrequent outages, it may not be possible to meet the April 1, 2010 deadline for the initial calibration of a flow meter or other measurement device without disrupting normal process operation. In such cases, the owner or operator may postpone the initial calibration until the next scheduled maintenance outage. The best available information from company records may be used in the interim. The subsequent required recalibrations of the flow meters may be similarly postponed. Such postponements shall be documented in the monitoring plan that is required under paragraph (g)(5) of this section. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (iv) Supporting documentation showing that it is not practicable to isolate the process equipment or unit and install the measurement device without a full shutdown or a hot tap, and that there was no opportunity during 2010 to install the device. Include the date of the three most recent shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, the frequency of shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, and the date of the next planned process equipment or unit shutdown. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (6) Measurement device installation deadline. Any owner or operator that submits both a timely initial notice of intent and a timely completed extension request under paragraph (j)(3) of this section to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by July 1, 2011 unless the extension request under this paragraph (j) is approved by the Administrator before July 1, 2011. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be purchased and delivered by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, include supporting documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was ordered, investigation of alternative suppliers and the dates by which alternative vendors promised delivery, backorder notices or unexpected delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery, and the current expected date of delivery. (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process unit shutdown. Include the date of the most recent process unit shutdown, the frequency of shutdowns for this process unit, and the date of the next planned shutdown during which the monitoring equipment can be installed. If there has been a shutdown or if there is a planned process unit shutdown between November 29 of the year during which the change in GWPs is published and April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, include a justification of why the equipment could not be obtained and installed during that shutdown. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. AGA means the American Gas Association Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. Continuous emission monitoring system or CEMS means the total equipment required to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings recorded at least once every 15 minutes, a permanent record of gas concentrations, pollutant emission rates, or gas volumetric flow rates from stationary sources.

Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Gas monitor means an instrument that continuously measures the concentration of a particular gaseous species in the effluent of a stationary source. Gaseous fuel means a material that is in the gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions and that is combusted to produce heat and/or energy. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Motor gasoline (finished) means a complex mixture of volatile hydrocarbons, with or without additives, suitably blended to be used in spark ignition engines. Motor gasoline includes conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline, and all types of oxygenated gasoline. Gasoline also has seasonal variations in an effort to control ozone levels. This is achieved by lowering the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of gasoline during the summer driving season. Depending on the region of the country the RVP is lowered to below 9.0 psi or 7.8 psi. The RVP may be further lowered by state regulations. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus.

The method(s) used shall be documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (iv) An oxygen (O<E T=""52"">2) concentration monitor may be used in lieu of a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 concentrations, in accordance with Equation F–14a or F–14b (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, if the effluent gas stream monitored by the CEMS consists solely of combustion products (i.e., no process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions or CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from sorbent are mixed with the combustion products) and if only fuels that are listed in Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter are combusted in the unit. If the O<E T=""52"">2 monitoring option is selected, the F-factors used in Equations F–14a and F–14b shall be determined according to section 3.3.5 or section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable. If Equation F–14b is used, the hourly moisture percentage in the stack gas shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. (B) The fuel provides less than 10 percent of the annual heat input to the unit, or if § 98.36(c)(3) applies, to the group of units served by a common supply pipe. (ii) May be used in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr for the combustion of natural gas and/or distillate fuel oil.

(iv) For the initial calibration of an orifice, nozzle, or venturi meter; in-situ calibration of the transmitters is sufficient. A primary element inspection (PEI) shall be performed at least once every three years. (v) For the continuously-operating units and processes described in § 98.3(i)(6), the required flow meter recalibrations and, if necessary, the PEIs may be postponed until the next scheduled maintenance outage. (vi) If a mixture of liquid or gaseous fuels is transported by a common pipe, you may either separately meter each of the fuels prior to mixing, using flow meters calibrated according to § 98.3(i), or consider the fuel mixture to be the “fuel type” and meter the mixed fuel, using a flow meter calibrated according to § 98.3(i). (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (4) You must use one of the following appropriate fuel sampling and analysis methods. The results of chromatographic analysis of the fuel may be used, provided that the gas chromatograph is operated, maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA, 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). The method(s) used shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (c) For the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, the CO<E T=""52"">2, flow rate, and (if applicable) moisture monitors must be certified prior to the applicable deadline specified in § 98.33(b)(5).

(5) If, for any source operating hour, quality assured data are not obtained with a CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor), flow rate monitor, or (if applicable) moisture monitor, use appropriate substitute data values in accordance with the missing data provisions of § 98.35. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel tr",,1,The answer is completely irrelevant to the context and question.,1,"The provided context does not address the specific scenario of monitoring fuel gas lines not owned or operated by a gas processing facility but located on the facility's property for equipment leaks, which is the question asked by the user.",1,0.0,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,3,"The document provides detailed information about monitoring equipment for measuring GHG emissions, including fuel flow meters and fuel gas systems.

For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part.

(3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L).

In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph.

Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. Chemical recovery furnace means an enclosed combustion device where concentrated spent liquor produced by the kraft or soda pulping process is burned to recover pulping chemicals and produce steam. Includes any recovery furnace that burns spent pulping liquor produced from both the kraft and soda pulping processes. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded.

Direct reduction furnace means a high temperature furnace typically fired with natural gas to produce solid iron from iron ore or iron ore pellets and coke, coal, or other carbonaceous materials. Distillate Fuel No. 2 has a minimum and maximum distillation temperature of 540 °F and 640 °F at the 90 percent recovery point, respectively, and includes fuels commonly known as Diesel Fuel No. 2 and Fuel Oil No. 2. This fuel is further subdivided into categories of sulfur content: High Sulfur (greater than 500 ppm), Low Sulfur (less than or equal to 500 ppm and greater than 15 ppm), and Ultra Low Sulfur (less than or equal to 15 ppm). Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fluid coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced in a fluidized bed system. The fluid coking unit includes equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for heat recovery on the fluid coking burner exhaust vent. There are two basic types of fluid coking units: A traditional fluid coking unit in which only a small portion of the coke produced in the unit is burned to fuel the unit and the fluid coking burner exhaust vent is directed to the atmosphere (after processing in a CO boiler or other air pollutant control equipment) and a flexicoking unit in which an auxiliary burner is used to partially combust a significant portion of the produced petroleum coke to generate a low value fuel gas that is used as fuel in other combustion sources at the refinery. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Gas monitor means an instrument that continuously measures the concentration of a particular gaseous species in the effluent of a stationary source. Gaseous fuel means a material that is in the gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions and that is combusted to produce heat and/or energy. Gasification means the conversion of a solid or liquid raw material into a gas. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Landfill gas means gas produced as a result of anaerobic decomposition of waste materials in the landfill. Landfill gas generally contains 40 to 60 percent methane on a dry basis, typically less than 1 percent non-methane organic chemicals, and the remainder being carbon dioxide. Liberated means released from coal and surrounding rock strata during the mining process. This includes both methane emitted from the ventilation system and methane drained from degasification systems. Low-bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate equal to or less than six standard cubic feet per hour. Maximum rated heat input capacity means the hourly heat input to a unit (in mmBtu/hr), when it combusts the maximum amount of fuel per hour that it is capable of combusting on a steady state basis, as of the initial installation of the unit, as specified by the manufacturer. Maximum rated input capacity means the maximum charging rate of a municipal waste combustor unit expressed in tons per day of municipal solid waste combusted, calculated according to the procedures under 40 CFR 60.58b(j). Mcf means thousand cubic feet. Methane conversion factor means the extent to which the CH<E T=""52"">4 producing capacity (B<E T=""52"">o) is realized in each type of treatment and discharge pathway and system. Thus, it is an indication of the degree to which the system is anaerobic. MMBtu means million British thermal units. Mscf means thousand standard cubic feet. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Primary fuel means the fuel that provides the greatest percentage of the annual heat input to a stationary fuel combustion unit. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Steam reforming means a catalytic process that involves a reaction between natural gas or other light hydrocarbons and steam. The result is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water. Still gas means any form or mixture of gases produced in refineries by distillation, cracking, reforming, and other processes. The principal constituents are methane, ethane, ethylene, normal butane, butylene, propane, and propylene. Supplemental fuel means a fuel burned within a petrochemical process that is not produced within the process itself. Trace concentrations means concentrations of less than 0.1 percent by mass of the process stream. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Ventilation system means a system that is used to control the concentration of methane and other gases within mine working areas through mine ventilation, rather than a mine degasification system. A ventilation system consists of fans that move air through the mine workings to dilute methane concentrations.

(a) Stationary fuel combustion sources are devices that combust solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, generally for the purposes of producing electricity, generating steam, or providing useful heat or energy for industrial, commercial, or institutional use, or reducing the volume of waste by removing combustible matter. Stationary fuel combustion sources include, but are not limited to, boilers, simple and combined-cycle combustion turbines, engines, incinerators, and process heaters. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit.

75,,"The provided input contains information relevant to the environmental regulations and calculations related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It mentions that facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W. Additionally, it includes details about calculation methods for GHG quantities and the methodology specified in subpart MM for comparing imported and exported quantities to the 25,000 metric ton CO2 per year threshold. The input also includes a table (Table W-1A) with population emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as gathering and boosting facilities in the Eastern and Western U.S. This table provides emission factors for different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic devices, pumps, and pipelines based on material type. These emission factors are crucial for calculating GHG emissions from the mentioned facilities. Overall, the input provides valuable information related to environmental regulations and the calculation of GHG emissions from specific types of facilities.","(e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods.

Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Crude oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities. (1) Depending upon the characteristics of the crude stream, it may also include any of the following: (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded.

Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Heavy Gas Oils are petroleum distillates with an approximate boiling range from 651 °F to 1,000 °F. Miscellaneous products include all refined petroleum products not defined elsewhere. It includes, but is not limited to, naphtha-type jet fuel (Jet B and JP–4), petrolatum lube refining by-products (aromatic extracts and tars), absorption oils, ram-jet fuel, petroleum rocket fuels, synthetic natural gas feedstocks, waste feedstocks, and specialty oils. It excludes organic waste sludges, tank bottoms, spent catalysts, and sulfuric acid. Naphthas (&lt;401 °F) is a generic term applied to a petroleum fraction with an approximate boiling range between 122 °F and 400 °F. The naphtha fraction of crude oil is the raw material for gasoline and is composed largely of paraffinic hydrocarbons. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Semi-refined petroleum product means all oils requiring further processing. Included in this category are unfinished oils which are produced by the partial refining of crude oil and include the following: Naphthas and lighter oils; kerosene and light gas oils; heavy gas oils; and residuum, and all products that require further processing or the addition of blendstocks. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Still gas means any form or mixture of gases produced in refineries by distillation, cracking, reforming, and other processes. The principal constituents are methane, ethane, ethylene, normal butane, butylene, propane, and propylene. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Unstabilized crude oil means, for the purposes of this part, crude oil that is pumped from the well to a pipeline or pressurized storage vessel for transport to the refinery without intermediate storage in a storage tank at atmospheric pressures. Unstabilized crude oil is characterized by having a true vapor pressure of 5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or greater. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (10) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography, IBR approved for § 98.74(c), § 98.164(b), § 98.244(b), § 98.254(d), § 98.324(d), § 98.354(g), and § 98.344(b).

(i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (i) Use Equation C–8a to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms. (ii) Use Equation C–8b to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu. (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (3) Special considerations for blending of fuels. In situations where different types of fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (for example, different ranks of coal or different grades of fuel oil) are in the same state of matter (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas), and are blended prior to combustion, use the following procedures to determine the appropriate CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor and HHV for the blend. (vi) If a mixture of liquid or gaseous fuels is transported by a common pipe, you may either separately meter each of the fuels prior to mixing, using flow meters calibrated according to § 98.3(i), or consider the fuel mixture to be the “fuel type” and meter the mixed fuel, using a flow meter calibrated according to § 98.3(i). (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (C) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil and for biogas, sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (F) For mixtures (blends) of solid fuels, weekly sampling is required to obtain composite samples, which are analyzed monthly. For blends of liquid fuels, and for gas mixtures consisting only of natural gas and biogas, sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. For gas mixtures that contain gases other than natural gas (including biogas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (d) Except as otherwise provided in § 98.33(b)(1)(vi) and (vii), when municipal solid waste (MSW) is either the primary fuel combusted in a unit or the only fuel with a biogenic component combusted in the unit, determine the biogenic portion of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using ASTM D6866–16 Standard Test Methods for Determining the Biobased Content of Solid, Liquid, and Gaseous Samples Using Radiocarbon Analysis) and ASTM D7459–08 Standard Practice for Collection of Integrated Samples for the Speciation of Biomass (Biogenic) and Fossil-Derived Carbon Dioxide Emitted from Stationary Emissions Sources (both incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). Perform the ASTM D7459–08 sampling and the ASTM D6866–16 analysis at least once in every calendar quarter in which MSW is combusted in the unit. Collect each gas sample during normal unit operating conditions for at least 24 total (not necessarily consecutive) hours, or longer if the facility deems it necessary to obtain a representative sample. Notwithstanding this requirement, if the types of fuels combusted and their relative proportions are consistent throughout the year, the minimum required sampling time may be reduced to 8 hours if at least two 8-hour samples and one 24-hour sample are collected under normal operating conditions, and arithmetic average of the biogenic fraction of the flue gas from the 8-hour samples (expressed as a decimal) is within ±5 percent of the biogenic fraction from the 24-hour test. There must be no overlapping of the 8-hour and 24-hour test periods. Document the results of the demonstration in the unit's monitoring plan. If the types of fuels and their relative proportions are not consistent throughout the year, an optional sampling approach that facilities may wish to consider to obtain a more representative sample is to collect an integrated sample by extracting a small amount of flue gas (e.g., 1 to 5 cc) in each unit operating hour during the quarter. Separate the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions into the biogenic and non-biogenic fractions using the average proportion of biogenic emissions of all samples analyzed during the reporting year. Express the results as a decimal fraction (e.g., 0.30, if 30 percent of the CO<E T=""52"">2 is biogenic). When MSW is the primary fuel for multiple units at the facility, and the units are fed from a common fuel source, testing at only one of the units is sufficient. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (ii) On an annual basis, at least 95 percent (by mass or volume) of the shared fuel is combusted in the large combustion unit(s), and the remainder is combusted in the small combustion sources. Company records may be used to determine the percentage distribution of the shared fuel to the large and small units; and (A) The results of each quarterly sample analysis, expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., if the biogenic fraction of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from MSW combustion is 30 percent, report 0.30). (4) Annual natural gas usage (therms/year) (Equation C–1a of § 98.33). (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). (31) Total quantity of each liquid fossil fuel combusted in the reporting year, as defined in § 98.6 (gallons) (Equation C–13). (34) High heat value of the each liquid fossil fuel (Btu/gallons) (Equation C–13). (a) CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from steam reforming of a hydrocarbon or the gasification of solid and liquid raw material, reported for each ammonia manufacturing process unit following the requirements of this subpart (CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions reported under this subpart may include CO<E T=""52"">2 that is later consumed on site for urea production, and therefore is not released to the ambient air from the ammonia manufacturing process unit). (b) CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit. You must report these emissions under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), by following the requirements of subpart C, except that for ammonia manufacturing processes subpart C does not apply to any CO<E T=""52"">2 resulting from combustion of the waste recycle stream (commonly referred to as the purge gas stream). (2) Liquid feedstock. You must calculate, from each ammonia manufacturing unit, the CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from liquid feedstock according to Equation G–2 of this section: (1) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (d) Calibrate all oil and gas flow meters that are used to measure liquid and gaseous feedstock volumes and flow rates (except for gas billing meters) according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for the Tier 3 methodology in § 98.34(b)(1). Perform oil tank drop measurements (if used to quantify feedstock volumes) according to § 98.34(b)(2). (ii) You must use representative data from the previous reporting year to estimate the consumption of input gas i as calculated in Equation I–13 of this subpart and the fraction of input gas i and by-product gas k destroyed in abatement systems for each stack system as calculated by Equations I–24A and I–24B of this subpart. If you were not required to submit an annual report under subpart I for the previous reporting year and data from the previous reporting year are not available, you may estimate the consumption of input gas i and the fraction of input gas i destroyed in abatement systems based on representative operating data from a period of at least 30 days in the current reporting year. When calculating the consumption of input gas i using Equation I–13 of this subpart, the term “f<E T=""52"">ij” is replaced with the ratio of the number of tools using input gas i that are vented to the stack system for which you are calculating the preliminary estimate to the total number of tools in the fab using input gas i, expressed as a decimal fraction. You may use this approach to determining f<E T=""52"">ij only for this preliminary estimate. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (3) As an alternative to developing apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption using a fab-specific engineering model, you may develop apportioning factors through the use of direct measurement using gas flow meters and weigh scales to measure process sub-type, process type, stack system, or fab-specific input gas consumption. You may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a fab-specific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5). (o) Fraction of each fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O fed into a process sub-type, process type, stack system, or fab that is fed into tools connected to abatement systems. (2) Each fluorinated gas transformation process that is not part of a fluorinated gas production process and where no fluorinated GHG reactant is produced at another facility. (3) Each fluorinated gas transformation process that is not part of a fluorinated gas production process and where one or more fluorinated GHG reactants are produced at another facility. (1) Procedure. To conduct the scoping speciation, select the stream(s) (including process streams or destroyed streams) or process vent(s) that would be expected to individually or collectively contain all of the fluorinated GHG by-products of the process at their maximum concentrations and sample and analyze the contents of these selected streams or process vents. For example, if fluorinated GHG by-products are separated into one low-boiling-point and one high-boiling-point stream, sample and analyze both of these streams. Alternatively, you may sample and analyze streams where fluorinated GHG by-products occur at less than their maximum concentrations, but you must ensure that the sensitivity of the analysis is sufficient to compensate for the expected difference in concentration. For example, if you sample and analyze streams where fluorinated GHG by-products are expected to occur at one half their maximum concentrations elsewhere in the process, you must ensure that the sensitivity of the analysis is sufficient to detect fluorinated GHG by-products that occur at concentrations of 0.05 percent or higher. You do not have to sample and analyze every stream or process vent, i.e., you do not have to sample and analyze a stream or process vent that contains only fluorinated GHGs that are contained in other streams or process vents that are being sampled and analyzed. Sampling and analysis must be conducted according to the procedures in paragraph (e) of this section. (13) If applicable, the number of containers of size and type j returned to the fluorinated gas production facility, N<E T=""52"">fj, (Equation L–34). (2) Equipped with a barrier fluid degassing reservoir that is routed to a process or fuel gas system or connected by a closed-vent system to a control device; or Equipment (for the purposes of § 98.123(d) and § 98.124(f) only) means each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, and instrumentation system in fluorinated GHG service for a process subject to this subpart; and any destruction devices or closed-vent systems to which processes subject to this subpart are vented. In fluorinated GHG service means that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a feedstock, by-product, or product that is a liquid or gas and contains at least 5 percent by weight fluorinated GHG. In gas and vapor service means that a piece of equipment in regulated material service contains a gas or vapor at operating conditions. In heavy liquid service means that a piece of equipment in regulated material service is not in gas and vapor service or in light liquid service. (a) A hydrogen production source category consists of facilities that produce hydrogen gas sold as a product to other entities. (c) This source category includes merchant hydrogen production facilities located within another facility if they are not owned by, or under the direct control of, the other facility's owner and operator. (1) Calibrate all oil and gas flow meters that are used to measure liquid and gaseous fuel and feedstock volumes (except for gas billing meters) according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for the Tier 3 methodology in § 98.34(b)(1). Perform oil tank drop measurements (if used to quantify liquid fuel or feedstock consumption) according to § 98.34(b)(2). Calibrate all solids weighing equipment according to the procedures in § 98.3(i). (2) Determine the carbon content and ",,5,"The provided input contains detailed and relevant information related to environmental regulations and the calculation of GHG emissions from specific types of facilities.

76,,"The document mentioned that the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids should be calculated based on the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. Additionally, it provides definitions for terms such as natural gas processing, fractionators, and bulk natural gas liquids, which are relevant to understanding the regulations and requirements for reporting emissions from these facilities. Furthermore, the document includes several tables (Table W-1A to Table W-5A) that offer default emission factors for various components and equipment types in onshore natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing facilities. These tables can be used to determine the emission factors for different equipment components and survey methods, which are essential for calculating emissions from the mentioned facilities.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (g) If a capacity or generation reporting threshold in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies, the owner or operator shall review the appropriate records and perform any necessary calculations to determine whether the threshold has been exceeded. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Sulfur recovery plant means all process units which recover sulfur or produce sulfuric acid from hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S) and/or sulfur dioxide (SO<E T=""52"">2) from a common source of sour gas at a petroleum refinery. The sulfur recovery plant also includes sulfur pits used to store the recovered sulfur product, but it does not include secondary sulfur storage vessels or loading facilities downstream of the sulfur pits. For example, a Claus sulfur recovery plant includes: Reactor furnace and waste heat boiler, catalytic reactors, sulfur pits, and, if present, oxidation or reduction control systems, or incinerator, thermal oxidizer, or similar combustion device. Multiple sulfur recovery units are a single sulfur recovery plant only when the units share the same source of sour gas. Sulfur recovery units that receive source gas from completely segregated sour gas treatment systems are separate sulfur recovery plants. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere.

(3) Special considerations for blending of fuels. In situations where different types of fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (for example, different ranks of coal or different grades of fuel oil) are in the same state of matter (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas), and are blended prior to combustion, use the following procedures to determine the appropriate CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor and HHV for the blend. (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (i) You must determine the amount of process N<E T=""52"">2O emissions that is sold or transferred off site (if applicable). You can determine the amount using existing process flow meters and N<E T=""52"">2O analyzers. (a) Ammonia manufacturing processes in which ammonia is manufactured from a fossil-based feedstock produced via steam reforming of a hydrocarbon. (b) Ammonia manufacturing processes in which ammonia is manufactured through the gasification of solid and liquid raw material. (a) CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from steam reforming of a hydrocarbon or the gasification of solid and liquid raw material, reported for each ammonia manufacturing process unit following the requirements of this subpart (CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions reported under this subpart may include CO<E T=""52"">2 that is later consumed on site for urea production, and therefore is not released to the ambient air from the ammonia manufacturing process unit). (1) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions (metric tons) for each ammonia manufacturing process unit. (3) Each fluorinated gas transformation process that is not part of a fluorinated gas production process and where one or more fluorinated GHG reactants are produced at another facility. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (B) Regardless of the level of uncontrolled emissions, the emission testing for process-vent-specific emission factor development may be conducted on the outlet side of a wet scrubber in place for acid gas reduction, if one is in place, as long as there is no appreciable reduction in the fluorinated GHG. (ii) Indicate whether the process is a fluorinated gas production process, a fluorinated gas transformation process where no fluorinated GHG reactant is produced at another facility, or a fluorinated gas transformation process where one or more fluorinated GHG reactants are produced at another facility. In heavy liquid service means that a piece of equipment in regulated material service is not in gas and vapor service or in light liquid service. Process means all equipment that collectively functions to produce a fluorinated gas product, including an isolated intermediate (which is also a fluorinated gas product), or to transform a fluorinated gas product. A process may consist of one or more unit operations. For the purposes of this subpart, process includes any, all, or a combination of reaction, recovery, separation, purification, or other activity, operation, manufacture, or treatment which are used to produce a fluorinated gas product. For a continuous process, cleaning operations conducted may be considered part of the process, at the discretion of the facility. For a batch process, cleaning operations are part of the process. Ancillary activities are not considered a process or part of any process under this subpart. Ancillary activities include boilers and incinerators, chillers and refrigeration systems, and other equipment and activities that are not directly involved (i.e., they operate within a closed system and materials are not combined with process fluids) in the processing of raw materials or the manufacturing of a fluorinated gas product. Process vent (for the purposes of this subpart only) means a vent from a process vessel or vents from multiple process vessels within a process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a fluorinated GHG-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere (or the point of entry into a control device, if any). Examples of process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, bottoms receivers, surge control vessels, reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. Process vents do not include vents on storage tanks, wastewater emission sources, or pieces of equipment.

This equipment also includes associated storage or measurement vessels, all petroleum and natural gas production equipment located on islands, artificial islands, or structures connected by a causeway to land, an island, or an artificial island. Onshore petroleum and natural gas production also means all equipment on or associated with a single enhanced oil recovery (EOR) well pad using CO<E T=""52"">2 or natural gas injection. (3) Onshore natural gas processing.

(2) For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, you have the option in the first two consecutive calendar years to determine “Count<E T=""52"">t” for Equation W–1 of this section for each type of natural gas pneumatic device (continuous high bleed, continuous low bleed, and intermittent bleed) using engineering estimates based on best available data. For the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment, you have the option in the first two consecutive calendar years to determine “Count<E T=""52"">t” for Equation W–1 for each type of natural gas pneumatic device (continuous high bleed, continuous low bleed, and intermittent bleed) using engineering estimates based on best available data. (ii) Acid gas content of feed natural gas. (ii) Feed natural gas water content. (iii) Outlet natural gas water content. (viii) Use of flash tank separator (and disposition of recovered gas). (2) Method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks according to equipment or event type. If you elect to determine emissions according to each equipment or event type, using unique physical volumes as calculated in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, you must calculate emissions as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and either paragraph (i)(2)(ii) or, if applicable, paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section for each equipment or event type. For industry segments other than onshore natural gas transmission pipeline, equipment or event types must be grouped into the following seven categories: Facility piping (i.e., piping within the facility boundary other than physical volumes associated with distribution pipelines), pipeline venting (i.e., physical volumes associated with distribution pipelines vented within the facility boundary), compressors, scrubbers/strainers, pig launchers and receivers, emergency shutdowns (this category includes emergency shutdown blowdown emissions regardless of equipment type), and all other equipment with a physical volume greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If a blowdown event resulted in emissions from multiple equipment types and the emissions cannot be apportioned to the different equipment types, then categorize the blowdown event as the equipment type that represented the largest portion of the emissions for the blowdown event. For the onshore natural gas transmission pipeline segment, pipeline segments or event types must be grouped into the following eight categories: Pipeline integrity work (e.g., the preparation work of modifying facilities, ongoing assessments, maintenance or mitigation), traditional operations or pipeline maintenance, equipment replacement or repair (e.g., valves), pipe abandonment, new construction or modification of pipelines including commissioning and change of service, operational precaution during activities (e.g. excavation near pipelines), emergency shutdowns including pipeline incidents as defined in 49 CFR 191.3, and all other pipeline segments with a physical volume greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If a blowdown event resulted in emissions from multiple categories and the emissions cannot be apportioned to the different categories, then categorize the blowdown event in the category that represented the largest portion of the emissions for the blowdown event. (iii) For onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities and LNG import and export equipment, as an alternative to using the procedures in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section, you may elect to sum the annual natural gas emissions as calculated using either Equation W–14A or Equation W–14B of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment type or event type. Calculate the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions for each equipment type or event type using the sums of the total annual natural gas emissions for each equipment type and the calculation method specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. (j) Onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks. Calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O (when flared) emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon produced liquids from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities (including stationary liquid storage not owned or operated by the reporter), as specified in this paragraph (j). For gas-liquid separators or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting non-separator equipment (e.g., stabilizers, slug catchers) with annual average daily throughput of oil greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 using Calculation Method 1 or 2 as specified in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section. For wells flowing directly to atmospheric storage tanks without passing through a separator with throughput greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using Calculation Method 2 as specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. For hydrocarbon liquids flowing to gas-liquid separators or non-separator equipment or directly to atmospheric storage tanks with throughput less than 10 barrels per day, use Calculation Method 3 as specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 for separators, you must also calculate emissions that may have occurred due to dump valves not closing properly using the method specified in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a vapor recovery system, you must adjust the emissions downward according to paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. (1) Calculation Method 1. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks. Calculate flashing emissions with a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state, models flashing emissions, and speciates CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that will result when the oil from the separator or non-separator equipment enters an atmospheric pressure storage tank. The following parameters must be determined for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from liquid transferred to tanks: (B) If separator or non-separator equipment oil composition and Reid vapor pressure data are available through your previous analysis, select the latest available analysis that is representative of produced crude oil or condensate from the sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or from the county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. (C) Analyze a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or each county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting for oil composition and Reid vapor pressure using an ap",,5,"The answer provides a comprehensive summary of the document, including the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants, definitions of relevant terms, and the availability of default emission factors in tables. It addresses all important aspects of the context and question accurately.",5,"The answer accurately summarizes the information provided in the context about the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants and the availability of default emission factors for various equipment types in onshore natural gas facilities. The answer also correctly identifies the definitions of relevant terms such as natural gas processing, fractionators, and bulk natural gas liquids.",1,0.0,1,The answer provides a clear and specific response to the question without any uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides relevant information about the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants and definitions for key terms. It also mentions the availability of default emission factors in tables for calculating emissions. However, the answer could be more coherent by organizing the information in a clearer and more structured manner.",892,,
77,,"{'Basis for 25 MMscfd Threshold': ""The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is that a facility must emit 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources. This threshold is used to determine the applicability of certain environmental regulations to the facility. If the facility's emissions exceed this threshold, it is subject to specific regulatory requirements related to emissions monitoring, reporting, and compliance. The threshold serves as a criterion for regulatory oversight and ensures that facilities with significant emissions are appropriately regulated to mitigate environmental impact."", 'Re-evaluation Frequency': 'The facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below the 25 MMscfd threshold whenever there is any change that could cause the facility to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Changes that trigger the re-evaluation include process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. This requirement ensures that facilities regularly assess their emissions status and compliance with regulatory thresholds in response to any modifications or expansions that may impact their emissions profile. By re-evaluating in response to changes, facilities can ensure ongoing compliance with environmental regulations and take corrective actions if necessary.'}","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (g) If a capacity or generation reporting threshold in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies, the owner or operator shall review the appropriate records and perform any necessary calculations to determine whether the threshold has been exceeded. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (j) Table A–2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (G) For each reported fluorinated GHG and fluorinated heat transfer fluid, report the following identifying information: (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1, 2010. The use of best available methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2010. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (iii) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, subsequent recalibrations of the flow meters and other measurement devices subject to the requirements of this paragraph (i) shall be performed at one of the following frequencies: (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (E) You shall periodically check the correlation(s) between the remote and actual readings (at least once a year), and make any necessary adjustments to the mathematical relationship(s). (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. Chemical recovery furnace means an enclosed combustion device where concentrated spent liquor produced by the kraft or soda pulping process is burned to recover pulping chemicals and produce steam. Includes any recovery furnace that burns spent pulping liquor produced from both the kraft and soda pulping processes. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fluid coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced in a fluidized bed system. The fluid coking unit includes equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for heat recovery on the fluid coking burner exhaust vent. There are two basic types of fluid coking units: A traditional fluid coking unit in which only a small portion of the coke produced in the unit is burned to fuel the unit and the fluid coking burner exhaust vent is directed to the atmosphere (after processing in a CO boiler or other air pollutant control equipment) and a flexicoking unit in which an auxiliary burner is used to partially combust a significant portion of the produced petroleum coke to generate a low value fuel gas that is used as fuel in other combustion sources at the refinery. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Gas monitor means an instrument that continuously measures the concentration of a particular gaseous species in the effluent of a stationary source. Gaseous fuel means a material that is in the gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions and that is combusted to produce heat and/or energy. Gasification means the conversion of a solid or liquid raw material into a gas. GPA means the Gas Processors Association. Heavy Gas Oils are petroleum distillates with an approximate boiling range from 651 °F to 1,000 °F. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. (4) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous into U.S. jurisdiction exclusively for U. S. military purposes. Maximum rated input capacity means the maximum charging rate of a municipal waste combustor unit expressed in tons per day of municipal solid waste combusted, calculated according to the procedures under 40 CFR 60.58b(j). Mscf means thousand standard cubic feet. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. (3) The equipment is located at a seasonal facility and operates during the full annual operating period of the seasonal facility, remains at the facility for at least two years, and operates at that facility for at least three months each year. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Sour gas means any gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide. Sour gas may include untreated fuel gas, amine stripper off-gas, or sour water stripper gas. Still gas means any form or mixture of gases produced in refineries by distillation, cracking, reforming, and other processes. The principal constituents are methane, ethane, ethylene, normal butane, butylene, propane, and propylene. Sulfur recovery plant means all process units which recover sulfur or produce sulfuric acid from hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S) and/or sulfur dioxide (SO<E T=""52"">2) from a common source of sour gas at a petroleum refinery. The sulfur recovery plant also includes sulfur pits used to store the recovered sulfur product, but it does not include secondary sulfur storage vessels or loading facilities downstream of the sulfur pits. For example, a Claus sulfur recovery plant includes: Reactor furnace and waste heat boiler, catalytic reactors, sulfur pits, and, if present, oxidation or reduction control systems, or incinerator, thermal oxidizer, or similar combustion device. Multiple sulfur recovery units are a single sulfur recovery plant only when the units share the same source of sour gas. Sulfur recovery units that receive source gas from completely segregated sour gas treatment systems are separate sulfur recovery plants. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98.

(a) Stationary fuel combustion sources are devices that combust solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, generally for the purposes of producing electricity, generating steam, or providing useful heat or energy for industrial, commercial, or institutional use, or reducing the volume of waste by removing combustible matter. Stationary fuel combustion sources include, but are not limited to, boilers, simple and combined-cycle combustion turbines, engines, incinerators, and process heaters. (1) Portable equipment, as defined in § 98.6. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5).

These factors are specified for different regions and services, as well as for specific components and material types in the distribution network.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part.

(c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year.

(2) Convert the mass of each imported and each GHG exported from paragraph (f)(1) of this section to metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part).

(4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart.

The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (4) A change in the GWP for one or more compounds includes the addition to Table A–1 of this subpart of either a chemical-specific or a default GWP that applies to a compound to which no chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart previously applied. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 means carbon dioxide emissions generated as the result of biomass combustion from combustion units for which emission calculations are required by an applicable part 98 subpart. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart.

(4) Flares, unless otherwise required by provisions of another subpart of this part to use methodologies in this subpart. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (A) If the results of fuel sampling are received monthly or more frequently, then for each unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than or equal to 100 mmBtu/hr (or for a group of units that includes at least one unit of that size), the annual average HHV shall be calculated using Equation C–2b of this section. If multiple HHV determinations are made in any month, average the values for the month arithmetically. (B) If the results of fuel sampling are received less frequently than monthly, or, for a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity less than 100 mmBtu/hr (or a group of such units) regardless of the HHV sampling frequency, the annual average HHV shall either be computed according to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section or as the arithmetic average HHV for all values for the year (including valid samples and substitute data values under § 98.35). (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (iii) For a gaseous fuel, use Equation C–5 of this section. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (ii) When the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration is measured on a wet basis, Equation C–6 of this section is used to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 emission rates: (v) Each hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack. (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (A) At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if necessary) Method 4 in appendices A–2 and A–3 to part 60 of this chapter to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 3A tests are required, to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration. A Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate (e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded during the test. (B) Calcu",,,,1,The answer does not address the given context and is not entailed by the information provided.,1,0.0,2,The answer attempts to provide information but conveys some uncertainty by using words like 'various' and 'default'.,4,"The answer provides a comprehensive summary of the document's content, including the calculation methods and reporting requirements for GHG emissions. However, there are a few instances where the answer could be more concise and better organized.",926,,
79,,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emissions from the data. It discusses the use of engineering assessments and commercial software products that follow chemical engineering principles for process vent emissions determinations. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of accurate measurements and documentation in the calculation of emissions. The equations involve factors such as conversion factors, emission factors, molecular weights, and stoichiometric ratios. The explanations are fragmented and contain errors, making it difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis of the equations. The document also provides specific equations and methods for calculating emissions from various processes and equipment, including CO2, CH4, and N2O. Furthermore, it includes tables such as Table W-1A, Table W-1B, Table W-1C, Table W-1D, and Table W-1E, which provide emission factors, component counts, and designations for different equipment and regions related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities in the Eastern and Western U.S.","(iii) Engineering calculations. (E) You shall periodically check the correlation(s) between the remote and actual readings (at least once a year), and make any necessary adjustments to the mathematical relationship(s). (iii) Engineering calculations. Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide stream means carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source (e.g. a power plant or other industrial facility) or extracted from a carbon dioxide production well plus incidental associated substances either derived from the source materials and the capture process or extracted with the carbon dioxide. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Fluid coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced in a fluidized bed system. The fluid coking unit includes equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for heat recovery on the fluid coking burner exhaust vent. There are two basic types of fluid coking units: A traditional fluid coking unit in which only a small portion of the coke produced in the unit is burned to fuel the unit and the fluid coking burner exhaust vent is directed to the atmosphere (after processing in a CO boiler or other air pollutant control equipment) and a flexicoking unit in which an auxiliary burner is used to partially combust a significant portion of the produced petroleum coke to generate a low value fuel gas that is used as fuel in other combustion sources at the refinery. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Steam reforming means a catalytic process that involves a reaction between natural gas or other light hydrocarbons and steam. The result is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water. Still gas means any form or mixture of gases produced in refineries by distillation, cracking, reforming, and other processes. The principal constituents are methane, ethane, ethylene, normal butane, butylene, propane, and propylene. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (17) ASTM D2597–94 (Reapproved 2004) Standard Test Method for Analysis of Demethanized Hydrocarbon Liquid Mixtures Containing Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide by Gas Chromatography, IBR approved for § 98.164(b). (20) ASTM D3588–98 (Reapproved 2003) Standard Practice for Calculating Heat Value, Compressibility Factor, and Relative Density of Gaseous Fuels, IBR approved for § 98.254(e). You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons; and (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation. (i) If only one type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart is combusted during the reporting year, substitute the cumulative annual heat input from combustion of the fuel into Equation C–10 of this section to calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 or N<E T=""52"">2O emissions. For units in the Acid Rain Program and units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, obtain the cumulative annual heat input directly from the electronic data reports required under § 75.64 of this chapter. For Tier 4 units, use the best available information, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate the cumulative annual heat input (HI)<E T=""52"">A. (C) For Tier 4 units, use the best available information (e.g., fuel feed rate measurements, fuel heating values, engineering analysis) to estimate the value of (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each type of fuel. Instrumentation used to make these estimates is not subject to the calibration requirements of § 98.3(i) or to the QA requirements of § 98.34. (4) If Equation C–1 or Equation C–2a of this section is selected to calculate the annual biogenic mass emissions for wood, wood waste, or other solid biomass-derived fuel, Equation C–15 of this section may be used to quantify biogenic fuel consumption, provided that all of the required input parameters are accurately quantified. Similar equations and calculation methodologies based on steam generation and boiler efficiency may be used, provided that they are documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required by § 98.3(g)(5). (i) If the fuels to be blended are received separately, and if the quantity (mass or volume) of each fuel is measured before the fuels are mixed and combusted, then, for each component of the blend, calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately. Substitute into Equation C–2a of this subpart the total measured mass or volume of the component fuel (from company records), together with the appropriate default CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor from Table C–1, and the annual average HHV, calculated according to § 98.33(a)(2)(ii). In this case, the fact that the fuels are blended prior to combustion is of no consequence. (ii) If the fuel is received as a blend (i.e., already mixed) or if the components are mixed on site without precisely measuring the mass or volume of each one individually, a reasonable estimate of the relative proportions of the components of the blend must be made, using the best available information (e.g., the approximate annual average mass or volume percentage of each fuel, based on the typical or expected range of values). Determine the appropriate CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor and HHV for use in Equation C–2a of this subpart, as follows: (B) Calculate a heat-weighted CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor, (EF)<E T=""52"">B, for the blend, using Equation C–16 of this section. The heat-weighting in Equation C–16 is provided by the default HHVs (from Table C–1) and the estimated mass or volume percentages of the components of the blend. (iii) Note that for the case described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if measured HHV values for the individual fuels in the blend or for the blend itself are not routinely received at the minimum frequency prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (or at a greater frequency), and if the unit qualifies to use Tier 1, calculate (HHV)<E T=""52"">B*, the heat-weighted default HHV for the blend, using Equation C–17 of this section. Then, use Equation C–16 of this section, replacing the term (HHV)<E T=""52"">B with (HHV)<E T=""52"">B* in the denominator, to determine the heat-weighted CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor for the blend. Finally, substitute into Equation C–1 of this subpart, the calculated values of (HHV)<E T=""52"">B* and (EF)<E T=""52"">B, along with the total mass or volume of the blend combusted during the reporting year, to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from combustion of the blend. (A) In Equation C–17, apply the term (Fuel)<E T=""52"">i only to the Table C–1 fuels. For each Table C–1 fuel, (Fuel)<E T=""52"">i will be the estimated mass or volume percentage of the fuel in the blend, divided by the sum of the mass or volume percentages of the Table C–1 fuels. For example, suppose that a blend consists of two Table C–1 fuels (“A” and “B”) and one fuel type (“C”) not listed in the Table, and that the volume percentages of fuels A, B, and C in the blend, expressed as decimal fractions, are, respectively, 0.50, 0.30, and 0.20. The term (Fuel)<E T=""52"">i in Equation C–17 for fuel A will be 0.50/(0.50 + 0.30) = 0.625, and for fuel B, (Fuel)<E T=""52"">i will be 0.30/(0.50 + 0.30) = 0.375. (b) Use Equation F–2 of this section to estimate CF<E T=""52"">4 emissions from anode effect duration or Equation F–3 of this section to estimate CF<E T=""52"">4 emissions from overvoltage, and use Equation F–4 of this section to estimate C<E T=""52"">2F<E T=""52"">6 emissions from anode effects from each prebake and Søderberg electrolysis cell. (2) Use Equation F–8 of this section to calculate emissions from bake furnace packing material. (a) Ammonia manufacturing processes in which ammonia is manufactured from a fossil-based feedstock produced via steam reforming of a hydrocarbon. (4) You must calculate the annual process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from each ammonia processing unit k at your facility according to Equation G–4 of this section: (b) You must calculate annual manufacturing capacity of a facility using Equation I–5 of this subpart. (a) You must calculate total annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG emitted by electronics manufacturing production processes from each fab (as defined in § 98.98) at your facility, including each input gas and each by-product gas. You must use either default gas utilization rates and by-product formations rates according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(6) of this section, as appropriate, or the stack test method according to paragraph (i) of this section, to calculate emissions of each input gas and each by-product gas. (1) If you manufacture semiconductors, you must adhere to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. You must calculate annual emissions of each input gas and of each by-product gas using Equations I–6 and I–7 of this subpart, respectively. If your fab uses less than 50 kg of a fluorinated GHG in one reporting year, you may calculate emissions as equal to your fab's annual consumption for that specific gas as calculated in Equation I–11 of this subpart, plus any by-product emissions of that gas calculated under paragraph (a) of this section. (i) You must calculate annual fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG used for the plasma etching/wafer cleaning process type using default utilization and by-product formation rates as shown in Table I–3 or I–4 of this subpart, and by using Equations I–8 and I–9 of this subpart. (6) If you are required, or elect, to perform calculations using default emission factors for gas utilization and by-product formation rates according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, and default values are not available for a particular input gas and process type or sub-type combination in Tables I–3, I–4, I–5, I–6, or I–7, you must use the utilization and by-product formation rates of zero and use Equations I–8 and I–9 of this subpart. (b) You must calculate annual fab-level N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from all chemical vapor deposition processes and from the aggregate of all other electronics manufacturing production processes using Equation I–10 of this subpart and the methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. If your fab uses less than 50 kg of N<E T=""52"">2O in one reporting year, you may calculate fab emissions as equal to your fab's annual consumption for N<E T=""52"">2O as calculated in Equation I–11 of this subpart. (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (d) You must calculate disbursements of input gas i using fab-wide gas-specific heel factors, as determined in § 98.94(b), and by using Equation I–12 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–12 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (e) You must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed, on a fab basis, for each process sub-type or process type j, using Equation I–13 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–13 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). If you elect to calculate emissions using the stack test method in paragraph (i) of this section, you must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed on the applicable basis by using an appropriate apportioning factor. For example, when calculating fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG consumed using Equation I–21 of this section, you must substitute the term fij with the appropriate apportioning factor to calculate the total consumption of each fluorinated GHG in tools that are vented to stack systems that are tested. (h) If you use fluorinated heat transfer fluids, you must calculate the annual emissions of fluorinated heat transfer fluids on a fab basis using the mass balance approach described in Equation I–16 of this subpart. (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account for the anticipated change in your preliminary estimate. You may account for such a change using a quantifiable metric (e.g., the ratio of the number of tools that are expected to be vented to the stack system in the current year as compared to the previous reporting year, ratio of the expected number of wafer starts in the current reporting year as compared to the previous reporting year), engineering judgment, or other industry standard practice. (iii) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG input gas consumed (in kg of fluorinated GHG emitted per kg of input gas i consumed) in the tools that vent to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–19 of this subpart. If the emissions of input gas i exceed the consumption of input gas i during the sampling period, then equate “E<E T=""52"">is” to the consumption of input gas i and treat the difference between the emissions and consumption of input gas i as a by-product of the other input gases, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. (iv) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG formed as a by-product (in kg of fluorinated GHG per kg of total fluorinated GHG consumed) in the tools vented to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. When calculating the by-product emission factor for an input gas for which emissions exceeded its consumption, exclude the consumption of that input gas from the term “∑(Activity<E T=""52"">if).” (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (2) The trigger points for change out you use to calculate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your containers. If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas. (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (1) You must demonstrate that the fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O apportioning factors are developed using calculations that are repeatable, as defined in § 98.98. (2) You must demonstrate the accuracy of your fab-specific model by comparing the actual amount of input gas i consumed and the modeled amount of input gas i consumed in the fab, as follows: (3) As an alternative to developing apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption using a fab-specific engineering model, you may develop apportioning factors through the use of direct measurement using gas flow meters and weigh scales to measure process sub-type, process type, stack system, or fab-specific input gas consumption. You may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a fab-specific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5). (2) You must calculate and document the uptime of abatement systems using Equation I–15 or I–23 of this subpart, as applicable. (h) You must adhere to the QA/QC procedures of this paragraph (h) when calculating annual gas consumption for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O used at each fab and emissions from the use of each fluorinated heat transfer fluid on a fab basis. (b) If you use fluorinated heat transfer fluids at your facility and are missing data for one or more of the parameters in Equation I–16 of this subpart, you must estimate fluorinated heat transfer fluid emissions using the arithmetic average of the emission rates for the reporting year immediately preceding the period of missing data and the months immediately following the period of missing data. Alternatively, you may estimate missing information using records from the fluorinated heat transfer fluid supplier. You must document the method used and values used for all missing data values. (2) Sample calculations used for developing the gas apportioning factors (f<E T=""52"">ij) for the two fluorinated GHGs used at your facility in the largest quantities, on a mass basis, during the reporting year. (7) Records of all inputs and results of calculations made to determine the average weighted fraction of each gas destroyed or removed in the abatement systems for each stack system using Equations I–24A and I–24B of this subpart, if applicable. The inputs should include an indication of whether each value for destruction or removal efficiency is a default value or a measured site-specific value. (6) Calculations and data used to determine annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG for each fab. (s) Where missing data procedures were used to estimate inputs into the fluorinated heat transfer fluid mass balance equation under § 98.95(b), the estimates of those data. Unabated emissions means a gas stream containing fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O that has exited the process, but which has not yet been introduced into an abatement system to reduce the mass of fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O in the stream. If the emissions from the process are not routed to an abatement system, or are routed to an abatement device that is not in an operational mode, unabated emissions are those fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O released to the atmosphere. (a) Determine the annual mass for each material used for the calculations of annual process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using Equation K–1 of this subpart by summing the monthly mass for the material determined for each month of the calendar year. The monthly mass may be determined using plant instruments used for accounting purposes, including either direct measurement of the quantity of the material placed in the unit or by calculations using process operating information. (c) If you are required to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions for an EAF at your facility as specified in § 98.113(d), the estimate is based an annual quantity of certain alloy products, so 100 percent data availability is required. (c) You must keep records that include a detailed explanation of how company records of measurements are used to estimate the carbon input and output to each EAF, including documentation of specific input or output materials excluded from Equation K–1 of this subpart that contribute less than 1 percent of the total carbon into or out of the process. You also must document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the measurements of materials fed, charged, or placed in an EAF including, but not limited to, calibration of weighing equipment and other measurement devices. The estimated accuracy of measurements made with these devices must also be recorded, and the technical basis for these estimates must be provided. (10) Annual mass of alloy product produced/tapped in the EAF (tons) (Equation K–1). (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (i) Engineering calculations. For process vent emission calculations, you may use any of paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A), (c)(1)(i)(B), or (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section. (1) To calculate emissions caused by the heating of a vessel without a process condenser to a temperature lower than the boiling point, you must use the procedures in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(3) of this chapter. (2) To calculate emissions from depressurization of a vessel without a process condenser, you must use the procedures in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(D)(10) of this chapter. (3) To calculate emissions from vacuum systems, the terms used in Equation 33 to § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(E) of this chapter are defined as follows: (C) Commercial software products that follow chemical engineering principles (e.g., including the calculation methodologies in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) and (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section). (ii) Engineering assessments. For process vent emissions determinations, you may conduct an engineering assessment to calculate uncontrolled emissions. An engineering assessment includes, but is not limited to, the following: (D) Design analysis based on chemical engineering principles, measureable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws or properties. (A) The destruction efficiencies of the device that have been demonstrated for the fluorinated GHGs in the vent stream for periods when the process vent is vented to the destruction device. (i) You must calculate uncontrolled emissions of fluorinated GHG by individual process vent, E<E T=""52"">PV, by using measurements, by using calculations based on chemical engineering principles and chemical property data, or by conducting an engineering assessment. Use the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, except paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. The procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section may be applied either to batch process vents or to continuous process vents. The uncontrolled emissions must be based on a typical batch or production rate under a defined operating scenario. The process activity rate associated with the uncontrolled emissions must be determined. The methods, data, and assumptions used to estimate emissions for each operating scenario must be selected to yield a best estimate (expected value) of emissions rather than an over- or underestimate of emissions for that operating scenario. All data, assumptions, and procedures used in the calculations or engineering assessment must be documented according to § 98.127. (ii) You must calculate a site-specific, process-vent-specific emission calculation factor for each process vent, each operating scenario, and each fluorinated GHG, in kg of fluorinated GHG per activity rate (e.g., kg of feed or production) as applicable, using Equation L–25 of this section. (3) Calculate and sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG in metric tons per year for equipment pieces for each process, E<E T=""52"">ELf, annually. You must include and estimate emissions for types of equipment that are excluded from monitoring, including difficult-to-monitor, unsafe-to-monitor and insulated pieces of equipment, pieces of equipment in heavy liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment where leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device. (1) Procedure. To conduct the scoping speciation, select the stream(s) (including process streams or destroyed streams) or process vent(s) that would be expected to individually or collectively contain all of the fluorinated GHG by-products of the process at their maximum concentrations and sample and analyze the contents of these selected streams or process vents. For example, if fluorinated GHG by-products are separated into one low-boiling-point and one high-boiling-point stream, sample and analyze both of these streams. Alternatively, you may sample and analyze streams where fluorinated GHG by-products occur at less than their maximum concentrations, but you must ensure that the sensitivity of the analysis is sufficient to compensate for the expected difference in concentration. For example, if you sample and analyze streams where fluorinated GHG by-products are expected to occur at one half their maximum concentrations elsewhere in the process, you must ensure that the sensitivity of the analysis is sufficient to detect fluorinated GHG by-products that occur at concentrations of 0.05 percent or higher. You do not have to sample and analyze every stream or process vent, i.e., you do not have to sample and analyze a stream or process vent that contains only fluorinated GHGs that are contained in other streams or process vents that are being sampled and analyzed. Sampling and analysis must be conducted according to the procedures in paragraph (e) of this section. (iii) Engineering calculations or assessments. (1) The data and calculations used to estimate the absolute and relative errors associated with use of the mass-balance approach. (2) The data and calculations used to estimate the mass of fluorine emitted from the process. (3) The data and calculations used to determine the fractions of the mass emitted consisting of each reactant (FER<E T=""52"">d), product (FEP), and by-product (FEB<E T=""52"">k), including the preliminary calculations in the former § 98.123(b)(8)(i). (3) Mass flow rate of the stream containing the fluorinated GHG(s) or surrogate into the device during the test. (4) Concentration (mass fraction) of each fluorinated GHG or surrogate in the stream flowing into the device during the test. (7) Test methods and analytical methods used to determine the mass flow rates and fluorinated GHG (or surrogate) concentrations of the streams flowing into and out of the destruction device during the test. Fluorinated gas product means the product of the process, including isolated intermediates. Uncontrolled fluorinated GHG emissions means a gas stream containing fluorinated GHG which has exited the process (or process condenser or control condenser, where applicable), but which has not yet been introduced into a destruction device to reduce the mass of fluorinated GHG in the stream. If the emissions from the process are not routed to a destruction device, uncontrolled emissions are those fluorinated GHG emissions released to the atmosphere. (c) For units using the calculation methodologies described in § 98.163(b), the records required under § 98.3(g) must include both the company records and a detailed explanation of how company records are used to estimate the following: (vi) For decarburization vessels, estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using Equation Q–6 of this section. (iii) You must calculate a site-specific emission factor for the process in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 per metric ton of feed or production, as applicable, by dividing the average hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 emission rate during the test by the average hourly feed or production rate during the test. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, determine the mass of each process input and output other than fuels using the same plant instruments or procedures that are used for accounting purposes (such as weigh hoppers, belt weigh feeders, weighed purchased quantities in shipments or containers, combination of bulk density and volume measurements, etc.), record the totals for each process input and output for each calendar month, and sum the monthly mass to determine the annual mass for each process input and output.

80,,"The given input does not provide specific information about the inclusion of the dehydrator or 'knockout pot' in the onshore natural gas processing source category. However, it does mention that the dehydrator is a device that directly contacts a natural gas stream to absorb water vapor and that emissions from dehydrator vents must be reported under the onshore natural gas processing segment. This implies that the dehydrator is indeed included in the onshore natural gas processing source category.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part.

Process vent (for the purposes of this subpart only) means a vent from a process vessel or vents from multiple process vessels within a process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a fluorinated GHG-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere (or the point of entry into a control device, if any). Examples of process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, bottoms receivers, surge control vessels, reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks.

If you elect to determine emissions according to each equipment or event type, using unique physical volumes as calculated in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, you must calculate emissions as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and either paragraph (i)(2)(ii) or, if applicable, paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section for each equipment or event type. For industry segments other than onshore natural gas transmission pipeline, equipment or event types must be grouped into the following seven categories: Facility piping (i.e., piping within the facility boundary other than physical volumes associated with distribution pipelines), pipeline venting (i.e., physical volumes associated with distribution pipelines vented within the facility boundary), compressors, scrubbers/strainers, pig launchers and receivers, emergency shutdowns (this category includes emergency shutdown blowdown emissions regardless of equipment type), and all other equipment with a physical volume greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If a blowdown event resulted in emissions from multiple equipment types and the emissions cannot be apportioned to the different equipment types, then categorize the blowdown event as the equipment type that represented the largest portion of the emissions for the blowdown event. For the onshore natural gas transmission pipeline segment, pipeline segments or event types must be grouped into the following eight categories: Pipeline integrity work (e.g., the preparation work of modifying facilities, ongoing assessments, maintenance or mitigation), traditional operations or pipeline maintenance, equipment replacement or repair (e.g., valves), pipe abandonment, new construction or modification of pipelines including commissioning and change of service, operational precaution during activities (e.g. excavation near pipelines), emergency shutdowns including pipeline incidents as defined in 49 CFR 191.3, and all other pipeline segments with a physical volume greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If a blowdown event resulted in emissions from multiple categories and the emissions cannot be apportioned to the different categories, then categorize the blowdown event in the category that represented the largest portion of the emissions for the blowdown event. (iii) For onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities and LNG import and export equipment, as an alternative to using the procedures in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section, you may elect to sum the annual natural gas emissions as calculated using either Equation W–14A or Equation W–14B of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment type or event type.

For wells flowing directly to atmospheric storage tanks without passing through a separator with throughput greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using Calculation Method 2 as specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. For hydrocarbon liquids flowing to gas-liquid separators or non-separator equipment or directly to atmospheric storage tanks with throughput less than 10 barrels per day, use Calculation Method 3 as specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 for separators, you must also calculate emissions that may have occurred due to dump valves not closing properly using the method specified in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a vapor recovery system, you must adjust the emissions downward according to paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (j)(5) of this section.

The following parameters must be determined for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from liquid transferred to tanks: (B) If separator or non-separator equipment oil composition and Reid vapor pressure data are available through your previous analysis, select the latest available analysis that is representative of produced crude oil or condensate from the sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or from the county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting.

Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section for wells with annual average daily oil production greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day that flow directly to atmospheric storage tanks in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting (if applicable). Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section for non-separator equipment with annual average daily hydrocarbon liquids throughput greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day that flow directly to atmospheric storage tanks in onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. (A) If well production oil and gas compositions are available through a previous analysis, select the latest available analysis that is representative of produced oil and gas from the sub-basin category and assume all of the CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 in both oil and gas are emitted from the tank. (1) Determine the GOR of the hydrocarbon production from each well whose associated natural gas is vented or flared. If GOR from each well is not available, use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category. (i) For onshore natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, determine the GHG mole fraction using paragraph (u)(2)(i) of this section. (ii) For onshore natural gas processing, when the stream going to flare is natural gas, use the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for all streams upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities. For onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, use the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas liquid for all streams. (iii) For any industry segment required to report to flare stack emissions under § 98.232, when the stream going to the flare is a hydrocarbon product stream, such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus and mixed light hydrocarbons, then you may use a representative composition from the source for the stream determined by engineering calculation based on process knowledge and best available data.

For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (G) For each reported fluorinated GHG and fluorinated heat transfer fluid, report the following identifying information: (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (i) Total quantity of GHG aggregated for all GHG from all applicable supply categories in Table A–5 of this subpart and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. (ii) Quantity of each GHG from each applicable supply category in Table A–5 to this subpart, expressed in metric tons of each GHG. For each reported fluorinated GHG, report the following identifying information: (viii) The facility or supplier must refer to the reporting instructions of the electronic GHG reporting tool regarding standardized conventions for the naming of a parent company. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010. Upon request by the Administrator, the records required under this section must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper documents. You must retain the following records, in addition to those records prescribed in each applicable subpart of this part: (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for which GHG emission were calculated. (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type. These data include but are not limited to the following information in this paragraph (g)(2): (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used. For data required by § 98.5(b) to be entered into verification software specified in § 98.5(b), maintain the entered data in the format generated by the verification software according to § 98.5(b). (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (3) The annual GHG reports. (5) A written GHG Monitoring Plan. (i) At a minimum, the GHG Monitoring Plan shall include the elements listed in this paragraph (g)(5)(i). (B) Explanation of the processes and methods used to collect the necessary data for the GHG calculations. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (iv) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall make all information that is collected in conformance with the GHG Monitoring Plan available for review during an audit. Electronic storage of the information in the plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available in hard copy upon request during an audit. (h) Annual GHG report revisions. This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (3) A substantive error is an error that impacts the quantity of GHG emissions reported or otherwise prevents the reported data from being validated or verified. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You must also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (v) Include a description of the proposed best available monitoring method for estimating GHG emissions during the time prior to installation of the meter. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Centrifugal compressor means any equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by centrifugal action, employing rotating movement of the driven shaft. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor dry seals mean a series of rings around the compressor shaft where it exits the compressor case that operates mechanically under the opposing forces to prevent natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 from escaping to the atmosphere. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. (2) With respect to fluorinated GHGs, the expiration of a fluorinated GHG to the destruction efficiency actually achieved. Such destruction does not result in a commercially useful end product. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Global warming potential or GWP means the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of one kilogram of a trace substance relative to that of one kilogram of a reference gas (i.e., CO<E T=""52"">2). GWPs for each greenhouse gas are provided in Table A–1 of this subpart. For purposes of the calculations in this part, if the GHG has a chemical-specific GWP listed in Table A–1, use that GWP. Otherwise, use the default GWP provided in Table A–1 for the fluorinated GHG group of which the GHG is a member. Greenhouse gas or GHG means carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2), methane (CH<E T=""52"">4), nitrous oxide (N<E T=""52"">2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and other fluorinated greenhouse gases as defined in this section. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas driven pneumatic pump means a pump that uses pressurized natural gas to move a piston or diaphragm, which pumps liquids on the opposite side of the piston or diaphragm. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process",,1,The input does not provide any relevant information related to the question.,1,The input does not provide any relevant information or equation related to the calculation of potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility.,1,0.0,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,3,"The answer partially addresses the coherence metric by discussing the calculation methodologies for GHG emissions in a natural gas processing facility, but the information provided is scattered and difficult to follow, resulting in partial coherence.",326,,
82,,"The given input provides a comprehensive overview of the tables related to Subpart W of Part 98. It includes information on default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., whole gas leaker emission factors, and total hydrocarbon emission factors. These tables are essential for understanding the emission calculations and reporting procedures for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. However, the input does not directly address the unclear explanation of fractionation and the lack of definition within the rule. Further clarification or correction is needed to provide a comprehensive explanation of the specific concerns raised about fractionation and its definition within the rule.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (j) Table A–2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (i) Electronics Manufacturing (subpart I). (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (ix) Manufacture of Electric Transmission and Distribution (subpart SS). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (4) A change in the GWP for one or more compounds includes the addition to Table A–1 of this subpart of either a chemical-specific or a default GWP that applies to a compound to which no chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart previously applied. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (ii) “I certify that I have all the necessary authority to carry out my duties and responsibilities under 40 CFR part 98 on behalf of the owners and operators of the facility or supplier, as applicable, and that each such owner and operator shall be fully bound by my representations, actions, inactions, or submissions.” (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. All terms used in this part shall have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and in this section. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Gasoline—Other is any gasoline that is not defined elsewhere, including GTAB (gasoline treated as blendstock). Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Semi-refined petroleum product means all oils requiring further processing. Included in this category are unfinished oils which are produced by the partial refining of crude oil and include the following: Naphthas and lighter oils; kerosene and light gas oils; heavy gas oils; and residuum, and all products that require further processing or the addition of blendstocks. Supplemental fuel means a fuel burned within a petrochemical process that is not produced within the process itself. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98.

(12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31, 2010. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (5) A written GHG Monitoring Plan. (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (C) Description of the procedures and methods that are used for quality assurance, maintenance, and repair of all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (iii) The owner or operator shall revise the GHG Monitoring Plan as needed to reflect changes in production processes, monitoring instrumentation, and quality assurance procedures; or to improve procedures for the maintenance and repair of monitoring systems to reduce the frequency of monitoring equipment downtime. (iv) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall make all information that is collected in conformance with the GHG Monitoring Plan available for review during an audit. Electronic storage of the information in the plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available in hard copy upon request during an audit. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You must also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (6) For units and processes that operate continuously with infrequent outages, it may not be possible to meet the April 1, 2010 deadline for the initial calibration of a flow meter or other measurement device without disrupting normal process operation. In such cases, the owner or operator may postpone the initial calibration until the next scheduled maintenance outage. The best available information from company records may be used in the interim. The subsequent required recalibrations of the flow meters may be similarly postponed. Such postponements shall be documented in the monitoring plan that is required under paragraph (g)(5) of this section. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (iv) Supporting documentation showing that it is not practicable to isolate the process equipment or unit and install the measurement device without a full shutdown or a hot tap, and that there was no opportunity during 2010 to install the device. Include the date of the three most recent shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, the frequency of shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, and the date of the next planned process equipment or unit shutdown. (v) Include a description of the proposed best available monitoring method for estimating GHG emissions during the time prior to installation of the meter. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Continuous emission monitoring system or CEMS means the total equipment required to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings recorded at least once every 15 minutes, a permanent record of gas concentrations, pollutant emission rates, or gas volumetric flow rates from stationary sources. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Gas monitor means an instrument that continuously measures the concentration of a particular gaseous species in the effluent of a stationary source. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel.

Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (ii) The minimum required sampling frequency for determining the annual average HHV (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or by lot) is specified in § 98.34. The method for computing the annual average HHV is a function of unit size and how frequently you perform or receive from the fuel supplier the results of fuel sampling for HHV. The method is specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) or (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, as applicable. (A) If the results of fuel sampling are received monthly or more frequently, then for each unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than or equal to 100 mmBtu/hr (or for a group of units that includes at least one unit of that size), the annual average HHV shall be calculated using Equation C–2b of this section. If multiple HHV determinations are made in any month, average the values for the month arithmetically. (B) If the results of fuel sampling are received less frequently than monthly, or, for a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity less than 100 mmBtu/hr (or a group of such units) regardless of the HHV sampling frequency, the annual average HHV shall either be computed according to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section or as the arithmetic average HHV for all values for the year (including valid samples and substitute data values under § 98.35). (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either ",,3,"The answer provides information about the methods for monitoring tank emissions and calculating GHG emissions, but does not directly address the question asked.",5,The answer accurately describes the methods for monitoring tank emissions and the use of best available monitoring methods for intermittent emissions. It also mentions the possibility of using an alternative method with approval from the Administrator.,3,0.0,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the methods for monitoring tank emissions and calculating GHG emissions. However, there is some room for improvement in the organization and flow of the information presented.",740,,
84,,"The provided input contains detailed information about various emissions sources and processes related to petroleum and natural gas production. It includes tables such as Default Whole Gas Emission Factors, Default Average Component Counts, Designation of Eastern and Western U.S., and Default Whole Gas Leaker Emission Factors, which provide emission factors, component counts, and designations for different regions and equipment types. However, specific guidance for transmission tank venting sent to the flare is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Further analysis and clarification of the input data is required to provide a comprehensive explanation of the relevant guidance for this specific scenario.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). Air injected flare means a flare in which air is blown into the base of a flare stack to induce complete combustion of gas. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Flare means a combustion device, whether at ground level or elevated, that uses an open flame to burn combustible gases with combustion air provided by uncontrolled ambient air around the flame. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere.

(viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (F) The installed gas or stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors are required, either by an applicable Federal or State regulation or by the unit's operating permit, to undergo periodic quality assurance testing in accordance with either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met. (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (a) CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from steam reforming of a hydrocarbon or the gasification of solid and liquid raw material, reported for each ammonia manufacturing process unit following the requirements of this subpart (CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions reported under this subpart may include CO<E T=""52"">2 that is later consumed on site for urea production, and therefore is not released to the ambient air from the ammonia manufacturing process unit). (c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (3) If you manufacture PVs, you must calculate annual production process emissions of each input gas i for threshold applicability purposes using gas-appropriate GWP values shown in Table A–1 to subpart A of this part and Equation I–3 of this subpart. (5) Emissions of fluorinated heat transfer fluids. (2) You must use the factor for N<E T=""52"">2O utilization for all other manufacturing production processes other than chemical vapor deposition as shown in Table I–8 to this subpart. (h) If you use fluorinated heat transfer fluids, you must calculate the annual emissions of fluorinated heat transfer fluids on a fab basis using the mass balance approach described in Equation I–16 of this subpart. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (r) For fluorinated heat transfer fluid emissions, inputs to the fluorinated heat transfer fluid mass balance equation, Equation I–16 of this subpart, for each fluorinated heat transfer fluid used. Stack system means one or more stacks that are connected by a common header or manifold, through which a fluorinated GHG-containing gas stream originating from one or more fab processes is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. For purposes of this subpart, stack systems do not include emergency vents or bypass stacks through which emissions are not usually vented under typical operating conditions. (1) Each fluorinated gas production process. (2) Each fluorinated gas transformation process that is not part of a fluorinated gas production process and where no fluorinated GHG reactant is produced at another facility. (3) Each fluorinated gas transformation process that is not part of a fluorinated gas production process and where one or more fluorinated GHG reactants are produced at another facility. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (v) Emissions from empty vessel purging must be calculated using Equation 36 to § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(H) of this chapter and the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or the conditions of the dedicated receiver. (C) Maximum flow rate, fluorinated GHG emission rate, concentration, or other relevant parameters specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the process vent. (A) The destruction efficiencies of the device that have been demonstrated for the fluorinated GHGs in the vent stream for periods when the process vent is vented to the destruction device. (A) You must conduct emission testing for process-vent-specific emission factor development before the destruction device unless the calculations you performed under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section indicate that the uncontrolled fluorinated GHG emissions that occur during periods when the process vent is not vented to the properly functioning destruction device are less than 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. In this case, you may conduct emission testing after the destruction device to develop a process-vent-specific emission factor. If you do so, you must develop and apply an emission calculation factor under paragraph (c)(4) to estimate emissions during any periods when the process vent is not vented to the properly functioning destruction device. (B) Regardless of the level of uncontrolled emissions, the emission testing for process-vent-specific emission factor development may be conducted on the outlet side of a wet scrubber in place for acid gas reduction, if one is in place, as long as there is no appreciable reduction in the fluorinated GHG. (vi) If you conducted emissions testing after the destruction device, you must calculate the emissions of each fluorinated GHG for the process vent (and operating scenario, as applicable) using Equation L–21 of this section. You must also develop a process-vent-specific emission calculation factor based on paragraph (c)(4) of this section for the periods when the process vent is not venting to the destruction device. (vii) If you conducted emissions testing before the destruction device, apply the destruction efficiencies of the device that have been demonstrated for the fluorinated GHGs in the vent stream to the fluorinated GHG emissions for the process vent (and operating scenario, as applicable), using Equation L–22 of this section. You may apply the destruction efficiency only to the portion of the process activity during which emissions are vented to the properly functioning destruction device (i.e., controlled). (i) You must calculate uncontrolled emissions of fluorinated GHG by individual process vent, E<E T=""52"">PV, by using measurements, by using calculations based on chemical engineering principles and chemical property data, or by conducting an engineering assessment. Use the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, except paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. The procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section may be applied either to batch process vents or to continuous process vents. The uncontrolled emissions must be based on a typical batch or production rate under a defined operating scenario. The process activity rate associated with the uncontrolled emissions must be determined. The methods, data, and assumptions used to estimate emissions for each operating scenario must be selected to yield a best estimate (expected value) of emissions rather than an over- or underestimate of emissions for that operating scenario. All data, assumptions, and procedures used in the calculations or engineering assessment must be documented according to § 98.127. (g) Emissions from venting of residual fluorinated GHGs in containers. If you vent residual fluorinated GHGs from containers, you must either measure the residual fluorinated GHGs vented from each container or develop a heel factor for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type that you vent. You do not need to estimate de minimis emissions associated with good-faith attempts to recycle or recover residual fluorinated GHGs in or from containers. (1) Process vent testing. Conduct an emissions test that is based on representative performance of the process or operating scenario(s) of the process, as applicable. For process vents for which you performed an initial scoping speciation, include in the emission test any fluorinated GHG that was identified in the initial scoping speciation. For process vents for which you did not perform an initial scoping speciation, include in the emission test any fluorinated greenhouse gas that occurs in more than trace concentrations in the vent stream or, where a destruction device is used, in the inlet to the destruction device. You may include startup and shutdown events if the testing is sufficiently long or comprehensive to ensure that such events are not overrepresented in the emission factor. Malfunction events must not be included in the testing. If you do not detect a fluorinated GHG that was identified in the scoping speciation or that occurs in more than trace concentrations in the vent stream or in the inlet to the destruction device, assume that fluorinated GHG was emitted at one half of the detection limit. (iii) You may sample the combined emissions and use engineering calculations and assessments as specified in § 98.123(c)(4) to allocate the emissions to each manifolded process vent, provided the sum of the calculated fluorinated GHG emissions across the individual process vents is within 20 percent of the total fluorinated GHG emissions measured during the manifolded testing. (7) Subsequent measurements. If a continuous process vent with fluorinated GHG emissions less than 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e, per § 98.123(c)(2), is later found to have fluorinated GHG emissions of 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or greater, you must conduct the emissions testing for the process vent during the following year and develop the process-vent-specific emission factor from the emissions testing. (ii) Indicate whether the process is a fluorinated gas production process, a fluorinated gas transformation process where no fluorinated GHG reactant is produced at another facility, or a fluorinated gas transformation process where one or more fluorinated GHG reactants are produced at another facility. (h) Reporting of emissions from venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers. Each fluorinated gas production facility that vents residual fluorinated GHGs from containers must report the following for each fluorinated GHG vented: (1) The mass of the residual fluorinated GHG vented from containers annually (metric tons). (2) Identify all batch process vents. (4) The emissions test data and reports (see § 98.124(c)(5)) and the calculations used to determine the process-vent-specific emission factor, including the actual process-vent-specific emission factor, the average hourly emission rate of each fluorinated GHG from the process vent during the test and the process feed rate, process production rate, or other process activity rate during the test. Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode associated with a vessel in a process; a vessel may have more than one batch emission episode. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from the charging of a vessel with a feed material will result in a discrete emission episode that will last through the duration of the charge and will have an average flow rate equal to the rate of the charge. If the vessel is then heated, there will also be another discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded vapor. Other emission episodes also may occur from the same vessel and other vessels in the process, depending on process operations. (2) Equipped with a barrier fluid degassing reservoir that is routed to a process or fuel gas system or connected by a closed-vent system to a control device; or (3) Equipped with a closed-loop system that purges the barrier fluid into a process stream. (1) Identified as a production process, a transformation process where no fluorinated GHG reactant is produced at another facility, or a transformation process where one or more fluorinated GHG reactants are produced at another facility; Process vent (for the purposes of this subpart only) means a vent from a process vessel or vents from multiple process vessels within a process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a fluorinated GHG-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere (or the point of entry into a control device, if any). Examples of process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, bottoms receivers, surge control vessels, reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. Process vents do not include vents on storage tanks, wastewater emission sources, or pieces of equipment.

(c) If GHG emissions from a hydrogen production process unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

However, it does not provide specific guidance for transmission tank venting sent to the flare, which is the main aspect of the question.",1,The provided input does not contain specific guidance for transmission tank venting sent to the flare. Further analysis and clarification of the input data is required to provide a comprehensive explanation of the relevant guidance for this specific scenario.,1,0.0,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,3,"The provided input contains information about various emissions sources and processes related to petroleum and natural gas production. However, specific guidance for transmission tank venting sent to the flare is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, it is partially coherent.",720,,
85,,"The given input provides detailed information about various aspects of the petroleum and natural gas systems, including definitions of terms and specific requirements for reporting emissions from different sources. However, there is no specific mention of leak checks for condensate tanks at natural gas transmission facilities. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is inconclusive whether only condensate tanks at the facilities require leak checks. The provided tables and equations mainly focus on emission factors for different components and materials in the petroleum and natural gas systems, but do not directly address the specific requirement for leak checks for condensate tanks at natural gas transmission facilities.","(iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (14) AP 42, Section 7.1, Organic Liquid Storage Tanks, November 2006 (AP 42, Section 7.1), http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/ch07/final/c07s01.pdf; in Chapter 7, Liquid Storage Tanks, of AP 42, Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, 5th Edition, Volume I, IBR approved for § 98.253(m)(1) and § 98.256(o)(2)(i).

In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (i) For containers with a maximum storage capacity of less than 9.08 kg (20 lbs) of gas, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 50 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type.

Process condenser means a condenser whose primary purpose is to recover material as an integral part of a process. All condensers recovering condensate from a process vent at or above the boiling point or all condensers in line prior to a vacuum source are considered process condensers. Typically, a primary condenser or condensers in series are considered to be integral to the process if they are capable of and normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse. (i) The number of sources of equipment type t with screening values greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv shall be determined using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7, and defining a leak as follows: (o) In their estimates of the mass of HFC–23 destroyed, HFC–23 destruction facilities shall account for any temporary reductions in the destruction efficiency that result from any startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions of the destruction device, including departures from the operating conditions defined in State or local permitting requirements and/or destruction device manufacturer specifications.

For hydrocarbon liquids flowing to gas-liquid separators or non-separator equipment or directly to atmospheric storage tanks with throughput less than 10 barrels per day, use Calculation Method 3 as specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 for separators, you must also calculate emissions that may have occurred due to dump valves not closing properly using the method specified in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a vapor recovery system, you must adjust the emissions downward according to paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. (1) Calculation Method 1. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks. Calculate flashing emissions with a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state, models flashing emissions, and speciates CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that will result when the oil from the separator or non-separator equipment enters an atmospheric pressure storage tank. The following parameters must be determined for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from liquid transferred to tanks: (ii) Flow to storage tank direct from wells. Calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using either of the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. (iii) Flow to storage tank direct from non-separator equipment.

(4) Determine if the storage tank receiving your separator oil has a vapor recovery system. (5) Determine if the storage tank receiving your separator oil is sent to flare(s). (k) Transmission storage tanks. For vent stacks connected to one or more transmission condensate storage tanks, either water or hydrocarbon, without vapor recovery, in onshore natural gas transmission compression, calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage as specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of this section. If emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (k)(5) of this section. (1) Except as specified in paragraph (k)(1)(iv) of this section, you must monitor the tank vapor vent stack annually for emissions using one of the methods specified in paragraphs (k)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. (ii) Use an acoustic leak detection device on each scrubber dump valve connected to the tank according to the method set forth in § 98.234(a)(5). (i) Use the storage tank emissions volume and gas composition as determined in paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) of this section. (ii) For onshore natural gas processing, when the stream going to flare is natural gas, use the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for all streams upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities. For onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, use the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas liquid for all streams. (iii) For any industry segment required to report to flare stack emissions under § 98.232, when the stream going to the flare is a hydrocarbon product stream, such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus and mixed light hydrocarbons, then you may use a representative composition from the source for the stream determined by engineering calculation based on process knowledge and best available data. (C) Use an acoustic leak detection device according to methods set forth in § 98.234(a)(5). (C) Use an acoustic leak detection device according to methods set forth in § 98.234(a)(5). (i) You must conduct at least one leak detection survey in a calendar year. The leak detection surveys selected must be conducted during the calendar year. If you conduct multiple complete leak detection surveys in a calendar year, you must use the results from each complete leak detection survey when calculating emissions using Equation W–30. For components subject to the well site and compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a of this chapter, each survey conducted in accordance with § 60.5397a of this chapter will be considered a complete leak detection survey for purposes of this section.

However, there is no specific mention of leak checks for condensate tanks at natural gas transmission facilities. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is inconclusive whether only condensate tanks at the facilities require leak checks. The provided tables and equations mainly focus on emission factors for different components and materials in the petroleum and natural gas systems, but do not directly address the specific requirement for leak checks for condensate tanks at natural gas transmission facilities.",1,0.0,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing detailed information about various aspects of the petroleum and natural gas systems, but does not directly answer the specific question about whether only condensate tanks at natural gas transmission facilities require leak checks. The answer lacks coherence in terms of addressing the specific question asked.",740,,
86,,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emission from the data. It outlines the conditions under which facilities are required to report GHG emissions and the different tiers of calculation methodologies that can be used based on the type of fuel and the capacity of the combustion unit. Additionally, it defines various terms related to natural gas transmission and compression, such as centrifugal compressor, blowdown vent stack emissions, and natural gas-driven pneumatic pump. The tables provide detailed information on emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, as well as average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities. These tables are valuable resources for understanding the emission factors and component counts required for calculating GHG emissions from natural gas transmission and compression activities.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part.

(iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e.

A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. Absorbent circulation pump means a pump commonly powered by natural gas pressure that circulates the absorbent liquid between the absorbent regenerator and natural gas contactor. Air injected flare means a flare in which air is blown into the base of a flare stack to induce complete combustion of gas. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Centrifugal compressor means any equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by centrifugal action, employing rotating movement of the driven shaft. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor dry seals mean a series of rings around the compressor shaft where it exits the compressor case that operates mechanically under the opposing forces to prevent natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 from escaping to the atmosphere. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. Continuous bleed means a continuous flow of pneumatic supply natural gas to the process control device (e.g. level control, temperature control, pressure control) where the supply gas pressure is modulated by the process condition, and then flows to the valve controller where the signal is compared with the process set-point to adjust gas pressure in the valve actuator. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps.

Emergency generator means a stationary combustion device, such as a reciprocating internal combustion engine or turbine that serves solely as a secondary source of mechanical or electrical power whenever the primary energy supply is disrupted or discontinued during power outages or natural disasters that are beyond the control of the owner or operator of a facility. An emergency generator operates only during emergency situations, for training of personnel under simulated emergency conditions, as part of emergency demand response procedures, or for standard performance testing procedures as required by law or by the generator manufacturer. A generator that serves as a back-up power source under conditions of load shedding, peak shaving, power interruptions pursuant to an interruptible power service agreement, or scheduled facility maintenance shall not be considered an emergency generator. Flare means a combustion device, whether at ground level or elevated, that uses an open flame to burn combustible gases with combustion air provided by uncontrolled ambient air around the flame. Fluid coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced in a fluidized bed system. The fluid coking unit includes equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for heat recovery on the fluid coking burner exhaust vent. There are two basic types of fluid coking units: A traditional fluid coking unit in which only a small portion of the coke produced in the unit is burned to fuel the unit and the fluid coking burner exhaust vent is directed to the atmosphere (after processing in a CO boiler or other air pollutant control equipment) and a flexicoking unit in which an auxiliary burner is used to partially combust a significant portion of the produced petroleum coke to generate a low value fuel gas that is used as fuel in other combustion sources at the refinery. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Gas monitor means an instrument that continuously measures the concentration of a particular gaseous species in the effluent of a stationary source. Gaseous fuel means a material that is in the gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions and that is combusted to produce heat and/or energy. High-bleed pneumatic devices are automated, continuous bleed flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate in excess of 6 standard cubic feet per hour. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Intermittent bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for automatically maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. These are snap-acting or throttling devices that discharge all or a portion of the full volume of the actuator intermittently when control action is necessary, but does not bleed continuously. Low-bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate equal to or less than six standard cubic feet per hour. Natural gas driven pneumatic pump means a pump that uses pressurized natural gas to move a piston or diaphragm, which pumps liquids on the opposite side of the piston or diaphragm. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Primary fuel means the fuel that provides the greatest percentage of the annual heat input to a stationary fuel combustion unit. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Reciprocating compressor means a piece of equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by positive displacement, employing linear movement of a shaft driving a piston in a cylinder. Reciprocating compressor rod packing means a series of flexible rings in machined metal cups that fit around the reciprocating compressor piston rod to create a seal limiting the amount of compressed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 that escapes to the atmosphere. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Unstabilized crude oil means, for the purposes of this part, crude oil that is pumped from the well to a pipeline or pressurized storage vessel for transport to the refinery without intermediate storage in a storage tank at atmospheric pressures. Unstabilized crude oil is characterized by having a true vapor pressure of 5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or greater. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (10) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography, IBR approved for § 98.74(c), § 98.164(b), § 98.244(b), § 98.254(d), § 98.324(d), § 98.354(g), and § 98.344(b). (25) ASTM D4891–89 (Reapproved 2006) Standard Test Method for Heating Value of Gases in Natural Gas Range by Stoichiometric Combustion, IBR approved for § 98.254(e) and § 98.324(d). (a) Stationary fuel combustion sources are devices that combust solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, generally for the purposes of producing electricity, generating steam, or providing useful heat or energy for industrial, commercial, or institutional use, or reducing the volume of waste by removing combustible matter. Stationary fuel combustion sources include, but are not limited to, boilers, simple and combined-cycle combustion turbines, engines, incinerators, and process heaters. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (iii) For a gaseous fuel, use Equation C–5 of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (viii) May be used for the combustion of a fuel listed in Table C–1 if the fuel is combusted in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr (or, pursuant to § 98.36(c)(3), in a group of units served by a common supply pipe, having at least one unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr), provided that both of the following conditions apply: (i) May be used for the combustion of any type of fuel in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less provided that the fuel is listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. (ii) May be used in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr for the combustion of natural gas and/or distillate fuel oil. (ii) Shall be used for a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr that combusts any type of fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (except MSW), unless either of the following conditions apply: (iii) Shall be used for a fuel not listed in Table C–1 of this subpart if the fuel is combusted in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr (or, pursuant to § 98.36(c)(3), in a group of units served by a common supply pipe, having at least one unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr), provided that both of the following conditions apply: (i) May be used for a unit of any size, combusting any type of fuel. Tier 4 may also be used for any group of stationary fuel combustion units, process units, or manufacturing units that share a common stack or duct. (E) The installed CEMS include a gas monitor of any kind or a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, or both and the monitors have been certified, either in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met. (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (c) Calculation of CH<E T=""54"">4 and N<E T=""54"">2O emissions from stationary combustion sources. You must calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions only for units that are required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the calculation methodologies of this subpart and for only those fuels that are listed in Table C–2 of this subpart. (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). The CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data for stationary fuel combustion sources shall be monitored as follows: (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (6) Biogenic fuel consumption and high heating value, as applicable, under §§ 98.33(e)(5) and (e)(6). (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (b) Units that use the four tiers. You shall report the following information for stationary combustion units that use the Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, or Tier 4 methodology in § 98.33(a) to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section: (2) Monitored common stack or duct configurations. When the flue gases from two or more stationary fuel combustion units at a facility are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere and if CEMS are used to continuously monitor CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions at the common stack or duct according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, you may report the combined emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units. This monitoring and reporting alternative may also be used when process off-gases or a mixture of combustion products and process gases are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere. Whenever the common stack or duct monitoring option is applied, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (x) For each type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart that was combusted during the report year in the units sharing the common stack or duct during the report year, the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (ii) On an annual basis, at least 95 percent (by mass or volume) of the shared fuel is combusted in the large combustion unit(s), and the remainder is combusted in the small combustion sources. Company records may be used to determine the percentage distribution of the shared fuel to the large and small units; and (2) For stationary combustion sources using the Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 Calculation Methodologies in § 98.33(a) to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions, the following additional information shall be kept on file and included in the GHG emissions report, where indicated: (f) Each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) subject to reporting under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section must indicate if both of the following two conditions are met: (1) The stationary fuel combustion source contains at least one combustion unit connected to a fuel-fired electric generator owned or operated by an entity that is subject to regulation of customer billing rates by the public utility commission (excluding generators that are connected to combustion units that are subject to subpart D of this part). (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or e",,1,There is no answer provided for the given question.,1,The provided answer does not accurately assess whether the ANSWER is entailed by the CONTEXT. The answer provides a summary of the document and does not evaluate the quality of the answer in the question-answering task.,1,0.0,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear and detailed explanation of the calculation methodologies for GHG emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources, as well as definitions for various terms related to natural gas transmission and compression. However, there are a few instances where the answer could be more coherent and organized.",990,,
87,,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive emissions from the data. It specifies that a facility or supplier must follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting specified in each relevant subpart of the regulation. The document also outlines specific definitions for various terms related to natural gas operations, such as emergency generator, centrifugal compressor, and natural gas liquids. It emphasizes the importance of reevaluating applicability whenever there are changes that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements. Additionally, it discusses alternative reporting options for facilities with shared fuel supplies and provides guidance on reporting combined emissions from multiple stationary fuel combustion units served by a common supply line. However, the majority of the equations and tables provided in the input are not directly related to the environmental regulations or natural gas compressor stations, and therefore do not directly address the question about subpart applicability for a natural gas compressor station.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (viii) Applicable source categories means stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all of the source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart present at the facility. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (B) Identification of the specific rule requirements (by rule subpart, section, and paragraph numbers) for which the instrumentation is needed. (iii) Date of submittal. (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (ii) Identification of the specific rule requirements (by rule subpart, section, and paragraph numbers) requiring the measurement device. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (B) Identification of the specific rule requirements (by rule subpart, section, and paragraph numbers) for which the instrumentation is needed. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Absorbent circulation pump means a pump commonly powered by natural gas pressure that circulates the absorbent liquid between the absorbent regenerator and natural gas contactor. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor means any equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by centrifugal action, employing rotating movement of the driven shaft. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor dry seals mean a series of rings around the compressor shaft where it exits the compressor case that operates mechanically under the opposing forces to prevent natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 from escaping to the atmosphere. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Emergency generator means a stationary combustion device, such as a reciprocating internal combustion engine or turbine that serves solely as a secondary source of mechanical or electrical power whenever the primary energy supply is disrupted or discontinued during power outages or natural disasters that are beyond the control of the owner or operator of a facility. An emergency generator operates only during emergency situations, for training of personnel under simulated emergency conditions, as part of emergency demand response procedures, or for standard performance testing procedures as required by law or by the generator manufacturer. A generator that serves as a back-up power source under conditions of load shedding, peak shaving, power interruptions pursuant to an interruptible power service agreement, or scheduled facility maintenance shall not be considered an emergency generator. Emergency equipment means any auxiliary fossil fuel-powered equipment, such as a fire pump, that is used only in emergency situations. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. Gas monitor means an instrument that continuously measures the concentration of a particular gaseous species in the effluent of a stationary source. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas driven pneumatic pump means a pump that uses pressurized natural gas to move a piston or diaphragm, which pumps liquids on the opposite side of the piston or diaphragm. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Reciprocating compressor means a piece of equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by positive displacement, employing linear movement of a shaft driving a piston in a cylinder. Reciprocating compressor rod packing means a series of flexible rings in machined metal cups that fit around the reciprocating compressor piston rod to create a seal limiting the amount of compressed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 that escapes to the atmosphere. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Sweet gas is natural gas with low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S) and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that does not require (or has already had) acid gas treatment to meet pipeline corrosion-prevention specifications for transmission and distribution. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (f) The following material is available for purchase from the Gas Processors Association (GPA), 6526 East 60th Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74143, (918) 493–3872, http://www.gasprocessors.com. (q) The following material is available from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586–8800, http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/field_code_master_list/current/pdf/fcml_all.pdf. (a) Stationary fuel combustion sources are devices that combust solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, generally for the purposes of producing electricity, generating steam, or providing useful heat or energy for industrial, commercial, or institutional use, or reducing the volume of waste by removing combustible matter. Stationary fuel combustion sources include, but are not limited to, boilers, simple and combined-cycle combustion turbines, engines, incinerators, and process heaters. (2) Emergency generators and emergency equipment, as defined in § 98.6. (3) Irrigation pumps at agricultural operations. (4) Flares, unless otherwise required by provisions of another subpart of this part to use methodologies in this subpart. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. The CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data for stationary fuel combustion sources shall be monitored as follows: (A) Apply Equation C–3, C–4 or C–5 of this subpart (as applicable) to each component of the blend, if the mass or volume, the carbon content, and (if applicable), the molecular weight of each component are accurately measured prior to blending; or (i) §§ 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (1) The stationary fuel combustion source contains at least one combustion unit connected to a fuel-fired electric generator owned or operated by an entity that is subject to regulation of customer billing rates by the public utility commission (excluding generators that are connected to combustion units that are subject to subpart D of this part). (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). (c) For each stationary fuel combustion unit that does not generate electricity, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C of this part. Follow the applicable quality assurance procedures for CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in appendices B, D, and G to 40 CFR part 75. (b) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C. (iii) Otherwise, you must submit the request within 45 days following promulgation of this subpart or within the first 30 days of each subsequent reporting year. (d) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the requirements of subpart C. (b) CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit. You must report these emissions under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), by following the requirements of subpart C, except that for ammonia manufacturing processes subpart C does not apply to any CO<E T=""52"">2 resulting from combustion of the waste recycle stream (commonly referred to as the purge gas stream). (b) Calculate and report under this subpart process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section for gaseous feedstock, liquid feedstock, or solid feedstock, as applicable. (c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (2) You must calculate and document the uptime of abatement systems using Equation I–15 or I–23 of this subpart, as applicable. (1) Review all inputs to Equations I–11 and I–16 of this subpart to ensure that all inputs and outputs are accounted for. (2) Test methods and procedures. You must adhere to the applicable test methods and procedures specified in Table I–9 to this subpart, or adhere to an alternative method approved by the Administrator (or authorized representative) according to paragraph (k) of this section. If you select Method 320 of 40 CFR part 63, Appendix A to measure the concentration of each fluorinated GHG in the stack system, you must complete a method validation according to Section 13 of Method 320 of 40 CFR part 63, Appendix A for each FTIR system (hardware and software) and each tester (testing company). Method 320 validation is necessary when any change occurs in instrumentation, tester (i.e., testing company), or stack condition (e.g., acid gas vs. base). Measurement of new compounds require validation for those compounds according to Section 13 of Method 320 of 40 CFR part 63, Appendix A. The field detection limits achieved under your test methods and procedures must fall at or below the maximum field detection limits specified in Table I–10 to this subpart. (iv) Neither the approval process nor the failure to obtain approval for the use of results from previous emissions testing shall abrogate your responsibility to comply with the requirements of this subpart. (k) You may request approval to use an alternative stack test method and procedure or to use an alternative method to determine abatement system destruction or removal efficiency by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (k)(1) through (6) of this section. An alternative method is any method of sampling and analyzing for a fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O, or the determination of parameters other than concentration, for example, flow measurements, that is not a method specified in this subpart and that has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction, using Method 301 in appendix A of part 63, to produce results adequate for the Administrator's determination that it may be used in",,1,The answer does not address the question at all and is completely irrelevant.,1,"The passage provides information about the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting specified in each relevant subpart of the regulation. It also defines various terms related to natural gas operations and emphasizes the importance of reevaluating applicability whenever there are changes that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements. However, the majority of the information provided is not directly related to the evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task.",1,0.0,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides information about the calculation methods, definitions of various terms related to natural gas operations, and emphasizes the importance of reevaluating applicability whenever there are changes that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements. However, some of the information provided is not directly related to the question about subpart applicability for a natural gas compressor station.",1184,,
88,,"The document provides detailed information on the applicability of subpart W of 40 CFR 98, which pertains to onshore petroleum and natural gas production. It outlines the reporting requirements for GHG emissions and includes several tables such as Table W-1A, W-1B, W-1C, W-1D, W-1E, and W-2. These tables contain emission factors, average component counts, and designations for different regions and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities. While the text does not explicitly mention CO2 pipelines, it does provide comprehensive details on the reporting requirements for facilities and suppliers subject to the regulations under subpart W.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (j) Table A–2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (ix) Manufacture of Electric Transmission and Distribution (subpart SS). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (viii) Applicable source categories means stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all of the source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart present at the facility. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (B) You may use the frequency recommended by the manufacturer or by an industry consensus standard practice, if no recalibration frequency is specified in an applicable subpart. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (ii) “I certify that I have all the necessary authority to carry out my duties and responsibilities under 40 CFR part 98 on behalf of the owners and operators of the facility or supplier, as applicable, and that each such owner and operator shall be fully bound by my representations, actions, inactions, or submissions.” (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Carbon dioxide production well means any hole drilled in the earth for the primary purpose of extracting carbon dioxide from a geologic formation or group of formations which contain deposits of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Carbon dioxide stream means carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source (e.g. a power plant or other industrial facility) or extracted from a carbon dioxide production well plus incidental associated substances either derived from the source materials and the capture process or extracted with the carbon dioxide. Centrifugal compressor means any equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by centrifugal action, employing rotating movement of the driven shaft. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor dry seals mean a series of rings around the compressor shaft where it exits the compressor case that operates mechanically under the opposing forces to prevent natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 from escaping to the atmosphere. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Reciprocating compressor means a piece of equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by positive displacement, employing linear movement of a shaft driving a piston in a cylinder. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Working capacity, for the purposes of subpart TT of this part, means the maximum volume or mass of waste that is actually placed in the landfill from an individual or representative type of container (such as a tank, truck, or roll-off bin) used to convey wastes to the landfill, taking into account that the container may not be able to be 100 percent filled and/or 100 percent emptied for each load. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98. The materials listed in this section are incorporated by reference in the corresponding sections noted.

(4) Flares, unless otherwise required by provisions of another subpart of this part to use methodologies in this subpart. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (4) Use Equation C–10 of this section for: units subject to subpart D of this part; units that qualify for and elect to use the alternative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methodologies described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section; and units that use the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. (C) For Tier 4 units, use the best available information (e.g., fuel feed rate measurements, fuel heating values, engineering analysis) to estimate the value of (HI)<E T=""52"">A for each type of fuel. Instrumentation used to make these estimates is not subject to the calibration requirements of § 98.3(i) or to the QA requirements of § 98.34. (1) You may use Equation C–1 of this subpart to calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the combustion of the biomass fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (except MSW and tires), in a unit of any size, including units equipped with a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS, except when the use of Tier 2 is required as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. Determine the quantity of biomass combusted using one of the following procedures in this paragraph (e)(1), as appropriate, and document the selected procedures in the Monitoring Plan under § 98.3(g): (B) The owner or operator shall document in the monitoring plan under § 98.3(g)(5) how the monthly sampling of each type of fuel is performed. (2) The owner or operator shall document in the monitoring plan under § 98.3(g)(5) how the monthly sampling of each type of fuel is performed. (iv) If, for a particular type of fuel, sampling and analysis for carbon content and molecular weight is performed at less than the minimum frequency specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, appropriate substitute data values shall be used in the emissions calculations, in accordance with the missing data procedures of § 98.35. (c) For the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, the CO<E T=""52"">2, flow rate, and (if applicable) moisture monitors must be certified prior to the applicable deadline specified in § 98.33(b)(5). (i) §§ 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. (5) If, for any source operating hour, quality assured data are not obtained with a CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor), flow rate monitor, or (if applicable) moisture monitor, use appropriate substitute data values in accordance with the missing data provisions of § 98.35. (4) Sorbent usage, when § 98.33(d) applies. (7) Fuel usage for CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions calculations under § 98.33(c)(4)(ii).

(a) You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if electronics manufacturing production processes, as defined in § 98.90, are performed at your facility and your facility meets the requirements of either § 98.2(a)(1) or (a)(2). To calculate total annual GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in § 98.2(a)(2), follow the requirements of § 98.2(b), with one exception. Rather than using the calculation methodologies in § 98.93 to calculate emissions from electronics manufacturing production processes, calculate emissions of each fluorinated GHG from electronics manufacturing production processes by using paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section, as appropriate, and then sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG by using paragraph (a)(4) of this section. (a) You must report emissions of fluorinated GHGs (as defined in § 98.6), N<E T=""52"">2O, and fluorinated heat transfer fluids (as defined in § 98.98). The fluorinated GHGs and fluorinated heat transfer fluids that are emitted from electronics manufacturing production processes include, but are not limited to, those listed in Table I–2 to this subpart. You must individually report, as appropriate: (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (g) If you report controlled emissions pursuant to § 98.94(f), you must calculate the uptime of all the abatement systems for each combination of input gas or by-product gas, and process sub-type or process type, by using Equation I–15 of this subpart. (viii) When using the stack testing option described in paragraph (i) of this section, you must calculate the weighted-average fraction of each fluorinated input gas i and each fluorinated byproduct gas k destroyed or removed in abatement systems for each fab f, as applicable, by using Equation I–24A (for input gases) and Equation I–24B (for by-product gases) of this subpart. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the ",,,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate summary of the information presented in the context, specifically regarding the applicability of subpart W of 40 CFR 98 to onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.

For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (vii) The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–6 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2011 until March 31, 2013. The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–7 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2013 until March 31, 2015 (as part of the annual report for reporting year 2014), except as otherwise specified in Table A–7 of this subpart. (viii) The facility or supplier must refer to the reporting instructions of the electronic GHG reporting tool regarding standardized conventions for the naming of a parent company. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (ii) The year and months covered by the report. (iv) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall make all information that is collected in conformance with the GHG Monitoring Plan available for review during an audit. Electronic storage of the information in the plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available in hard copy upon request during an audit. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section, upon request by the owner or operator, the Administrator may provide reasonable extensions of the 45-day period for submission of the revised report or information under paragraphs (h)(1) and (2). If the Administrator receives a request for extension of the 45-day period, by email to an address prescribed by the Administrator prior to the expiration of the 45-day period, the extension request is deemed to be automatically granted for 30 days. The Administrator may grant an additional extension beyond the automatic 30-day extension if the owner or operator submits a request for an additional extension and the request is received by the Administrator prior to the expiration of the automatic 30-day extension, provided the request demonstrates that it is not practicable to submit a revised report or information under paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) within 75 days. The Administrator will approve the extension request if the request demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not practicable to collect and process the data needed to resolve potential reporting errors identified pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) or (2) within 75 days. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (1) Each such submission shall include the following certification statement signed by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative: “I am authorized to make this submission on behalf of the owners and operators of the facility or supplier, as applicable, for which the submission is made. I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined, and am familiar with, the statements and information submitted in this document and all its attachments. Based on my inquiry of those individuals with primary responsibility for obtaining the information, I certify that the statements and information are to the best of my knowledge and belief true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false statements and information or omitting required statements and information, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment.” (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Liberated means released from coal and surrounding rock strata during the mining process. This includes both methane emitted from the ventilation system and methane drained from degasification systems. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (i) Use Equation C–8a to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms. (ii) Use Equation C–8b to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu. (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (iii) The provisions of an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (c) Reporting alternatives for units using the four Tiers. You may use any of the applicable reporting alternatives of this paragraph to simplify the unit-level reporting required under paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (iii) The use of this reporting option is documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). Indicate in the Monitoring Plan which units share the common fuel supply and the method used to demonstrate that this alternative reporting option applies. For the small combustion sources, a description of the types of units and the approximate number of units is sufficient. (1) The applicable verification data specified in this paragraph (e) are not required to be kept on file or reported for units that meet any one of the three following conditions: (iii) Are not in the Acid Rain Program, but are required to monitor and report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and heat input data year-round, in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. (f) Each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) subject to reporting under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section must indicate if both of the following two conditions are met: (4) Annual natural gas usage (therms/year) (Equation C–1a of § 98.33). (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more electricity generating units and the facility meets the requirements of § 98.2(a)(1). (a) For each electricity generating unit that is subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program or is otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under this subpart the annual mass emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CH<E T=""52"">4 by following the requirements of this subpart. (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. The annual report shall comply with the data reporting requirements specified in § 98.36(d)(1). You shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements of §§ 98.3(g) and 98.37. Records retained under § 75.57(h) of this chapter for missing data events satisfy the recordkeeping requirements of § 98.3(g)(4) for those same events. (ii) You must notify the EPA of your use of a previously approved alternative method in your annual report. (iii) Otherwise, you must submit the request within 45 days following promulgation of this subpart or within the first 30 days of each subsequent reporting year. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (n) of this section at the facility level. You must report: In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), you must report the following information at the facility level: In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as appropriate. (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account ",,,,1,"The given context does not provide any information related to unintentional natural gas releases and reporting obligations.

It outlines the conditions for reporting emissions, calculation of annual emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorinated GHGs, and comparison of emissions to the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year threshold. Additionally, it provides guidelines for discontinuing reporting if emissions fall below certain thresholds for consecutive years. The document emphasizes the importance of using specific calculation methodologies and maintaining records for emissions calculations, providing a comprehensive framework for reporting GHG emissions.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (v) Indicate (yes or no) whether reported emissions include emissions from a cogeneration unit located at the facility. (viii) Applicable source categories means stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all of the source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart present at the facility. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (A) Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units). (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (13) An indication of whether the facility includes one or more plant sites that have been assigned a “plant code” (as defined under § 98.6) by either the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration or by the EPA's Clean Air Markets Division. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

(4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part.

Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Carbon dioxide stream means carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source (e.g. a power plant or other industrial facility) or extracted from a carbon dioxide production well plus incidental associated substances either derived from the source materials and the capture process or extracted with the carbon dioxide. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included.

Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. (4) Emissions Inventory Improvement Program, Volume II: Chapter 16, Methods for Estimating Air Emissions from Chemical Manufacturing Facilities, August 2007, Final, http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/eiip/techreport/volume02/index.html, IBR approved for § 98.123(c)(1)(i)(A). (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (G) Finally, add the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the unit. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Use the hourly heat input data from appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, together with Equation G–4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates, in units of tons/hr; (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and C",,5,"The answer provides a comprehensive summary of the document, covering the conditions for reporting emissions, calculation methodologies, and guidelines for discontinuing reporting.

91,,"The provided text contains detailed descriptions and definitions related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas systems, and various industry segments. It outlines reporting requirements for different industry segments and specifies methods for reporting emissions from various equipment and activities. However, it does not explicitly clarify whether natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W. The text also includes a mix of LaTeX equations, some of which are not properly formatted. These equations likely represent calculations and measurements related to emissions, such as CO2 emissions, N2O emissions, emission factors, stoichiometric ratios, and inventory of gases. The equations also involve factors such as carbon content, molar volume conversion, and abatement utilization. Additionally, the text includes Table W-1A, which provides default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. The table includes population emission factors for various components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S., as well as gathering pipelines by material type. However, it does not directly address the specific query about the classification of natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations under Subpart W.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Gaseous fuel means a material that is in the gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions and that is combusted to produce heat and/or energy. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Unstabilized crude oil means, for the purposes of this part, crude oil that is pumped from the well to a pipeline or pressurized storage vessel for transport to the refinery without intermediate storage in a storage tank at atmospheric pressures. Unstabilized crude oil is characterized by having a true vapor pressure of 5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or greater. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (i) For containers with a maximum storage capacity of less than 9.08 kg (20 lbs) of gas, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 50 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type. (4) The fluorinated GHG is not an expected or possible by-product identified in Table I–17 of this subpart. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (3) Onshore natural gas processing. Natural gas processing means the separation of natural gas liquids (NGLs) or non-methane gases from produced natural gas, or the separation of NGLs into one or more component mixtures. Separation includes one or more of the following: forced extraction of natural gas liquids, sulfur and carbon dioxide removal, fractionation of NGLs, or the capture of CO<E T=""52"">2 separated from natural gas streams. This segment also includes all residue gas compression equipment owned or operated by the natural gas processing plant. This industry segment includes processing plants that fractionate gas liquids, and processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. (4) Onshore natural gas transmission compression. Onshore natural gas transmission compression means any stationary combination of compressors that move natural gas from production fields, natural gas processing plants, or other transmission compressors through transmission pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage. In addition, a transmission compressor station includes equipment for liquids separation, and tanks for the storage of water and hydrocarbon liquids. Residue (sales) gas compression that is part of onshore natural gas processing plants are included in the onshore natural gas processing segment and are excluded from this segment. (5) Underground natural gas storage. Underground natural gas storage means subsurface storage, including depleted gas or oil reservoirs and salt dome caverns that store natural gas that has been transferred from its original location for the primary purpose of load balancing (the process of equalizing the receipt and delivery of natural gas); natural gas underground storage processes and operations (including compression, dehydration and flow measurement, and excluding transmission pipelines); and all the wellheads connected to the compression units located at the facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs. (6) Liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. LNG storage means onshore LNG storage vessels located above ground, equipment for liquefying natural gas, compressors to capture and re-liquefy boil-off-gas, re-condensers, and vaporization units for re-gasification of the liquefied natural gas. (9) Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting means gathering pipelines and other equipment used to collect petroleum and/or natural gas from onshore production gas or oil wells and used to compress, dehydrate, sweeten, or transport the petroleum and/or natural gas to a natural gas processing facility, a natural gas transmission pipeline or to a natural gas distribution pipeline. Gathering and boosting equipment includes, but is not limited to gathering pipelines, separators, compressors, acid gas removal units, dehydrators, pneumatic devices/pumps, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares. Gathering and boosting equipment does not include equipment reported under any other industry segment defined in this section. Gathering pipelines operating on a vacuum and gathering pipelines with a GOR) less than 300 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel (scf/STB) are not included in this industry segment (oil here refers to hydrocarbon liquids of all API gravities). (10) Onshore natural gas transmission pipeline. Onshore natural gas transmission pipeline means all natural gas transmission pipelines as defined in § 98.238. (a) You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains petroleum and natural gas systems and the facility meets the requirements of § 98.2(a)(2), except for the industry segments in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.

Stationary or portable equipment are the following equipment, which are integral to the extraction, processing, or movement of oil or natural gas: well drilling and completion equipment, workover equipment, natural gas dehydrators, natural gas compressors, electrical generators, steam boilers, and process heaters. (e) For onshore natural gas transmission compression, report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the following sources: (3) Transmission storage tanks.

Stationary or portable equipment includes the following equipment, which are integral to the movement of natural gas: Natural gas dehydrators, natural gas compressors, electrical generators, steam boilers, and process heaters. (k) Report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the requirements of subpart C except for facilities under onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and natural gas distribution. Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report stationary and portable combustion emissions as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Natural gas distribution facilities must report stationary combustion emissions as specified in paragraph (i) of this section. Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must report stationary and portable combustion emissions as specified in paragraph (j) of this section. (m) For onshore natural gas transmission pipeline, report pipeline blowdown CO<E T=""52"">2 and CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions from blowdown vent stacks. (2) For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, you have the option in the first two consecutive calendar years to determine “Count<E T=""52"">t” for Equation W–1 of this section for each type of natural gas pneumatic device (continuous high bleed, continuous low bleed, and intermittent bleed) using engineering estimates based on best available data. For the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment, you have the option in the first two consecutive calendar years to determine “Count<E T=""52"">t” for Equation W–1 for each type of natural gas pneumatic device (continuous high bleed, continuous low bleed, and intermittent bleed) using engineering estimates based on best available data. (iii) Acid gas content of outlet natural gas. (iii) If a continuous gas analyzer is not available or installed, you may use the outlet pipeline quality specification for CO<E T=""52"">2 in natural gas. (iii) Outlet natural gas water content. (iii) For onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities and LNG import and export equipment, as an alternative to using the procedures in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section, you may elect to sum the annual natural gas emissions as calculated using either Equation W–14A or Equation W–14B of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment type or event type. Calculate the total annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 volumetric and mass emissions for each equipment type or event type using the sums of the total annual natural gas emissions for each equipment type and the calculation method specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. (j) Onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks. Calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O (when flared) emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon produced liquids from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities (including stationary liquid storage not owned or operated by the reporter), as specified in this paragraph (j). For gas-liquid separators or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting non-separator equipment (e.g., stabilizers, slug catchers) with annual average daily throughput of oil greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 using Calculation Method 1 or 2 as specified in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section. For wells flowing directly to atmospheric storage tanks without passing through a separator with throughput greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using Calculation Method 2 as specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. For hydrocarbon liquids flowing to gas-liquid separators or non-separator equipment or directly to atmospheric storage tanks with throughput less than 10 barrels per day, use Calculation Method 3 as specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 for separators, you must also calculate emissions that may have occurred due to dump valves not closing properly using the method specified in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a vapor recovery system, you must adjust the emissions downward according to paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. (1) Calculation Method 1. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks. Calculate flashing emissions with a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state, models flashing emissions, and speciates CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that will result when the oil from the separator or non-separator equipment enters an atmospheric pressure storage tank. The following parameters must be determined for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from liquid transferred to tanks: (k) Transmission storage tanks. For vent stacks connected to one or more transmission condensate storage tanks, either water or hydrocarbon, without vapor recovery, in onshore natural gas transmission compression, calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage as specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of this section. If emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (k)(5) of this section. (iii) Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must use the appropriate default whole gas leaker emission factors for components in gas service, light crude service, and heavy crude service listed in Table W–1E to this subpart. (iv) Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must use the appropriate default whole gas leaker factors for components in gas service listed in Table W–1E to this subpart.

(viii) LNG storage facilities must use the appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components in LNG service or gas service listed in Table W–5A to this subpart. (x) Natural gas distribution facilities must use Equation W–30 of this section and the default methane leaker emission factors for transmission-distribution transfer station components in gas service listed in Table W–7 to this subpart to calculate component emissions from annual equipment leak surveys conducted at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. Natural gas distribution facilities are required to perform equipment leak surveys only at above grade stations that qualify as transmission-distribution transfer stations. Below grade transmission-distribution transfer stations and all metering-regulating stations that do not meet the definition of transmission-distribution transfer stations are not required to perform equipment leak surveys under this section.

Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Sweet gas is natural gas with low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S) and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that does not require (or has already had) acid gas treatment to meet pipeline corrosion-prevention specifications for transmission and distribution. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (2) GPA 2261–00 Analysis for Natural Gas and Similar Gaseous Mixtures by Gas Chromatography, IBR approved for § 98.164(b), § 98.254(d), § 98.344(b), and § 98.354(g).

(i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (i) Use Equation C–8a to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms. (ii) Use Equation C–8b to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu. (i) If the mass or volume of each component fuel in the blend is measured before the fuels are mixed and combusted, calculate and report CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions separately for each component fuel, using the applicable procedures in this paragraph (c). (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart. (i) If the fuels to be blended are received separately, and if the quantity (mass or volume) of each fuel is measured before the fuels are mixed and combusted, then, for each component of the blend, calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately. Substitute into Equation C–2a of this subpart the total measured mass or volume of the component fuel (from company records), together with the appropriate default CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor from Table C–1, and the annual average HHV, calculated according to § 98.33(a)(2)(ii). In this case, the fact that the fuels are blended prior to combustion is of no consequence. (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (2) Monitored common stack or duct configurations. When the flue gases from two or more stationary fuel combustion units at a facility are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere and if CEMS are used to continuously monitor CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions at the common stack or duct according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, you may report the combined emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units. This monitoring and reporting alternative may also be used when process off-gases or a mixture of combustion products and process gases are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere. Whenever the common stack or duct monitoring option is applied, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. (4) Annual natural gas usage (therms/year) (Equation C–1a of § 98.33). (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). (c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (i) For containers with a maximum storage capacity of less than 9.08 kg (20 lbs) of gas, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 50 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type. (4) As part of normal operations for each fab, the inventory of gas stored in containers at the beginning of the reporting year must be the same as the inventory of gas stored in containers at the end of the previous reporting year. You must maintain records documenting the year end and year beginning inventories under § 98.97(a). (4) Ensure that the total quantity of gas i in containers in service at the end of a reporting year is accounted for as if the in-service containers were full for Equation I–11 of this subpart. Ensure also that the same quantity is accounted for in the inventory of input gas i stored in containers at the beginning of the subsequent reporting year. (c) If GHG emissions from an EAF are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (ii) You must assume that all of the components contained in the condenser exit vent stream are in equilibrium with the same components in the exit condensate stream (except for noncondensables). (3) Calculate and sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG in metric tons per year for equipment pieces for each process, E<E T=""52"">ELf, annually.

95,,"The provided input contains detailed information about the greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements, including calculation methodologies, reporting conditions, emission thresholds, and submission schedules. However, it does not directly address the specific question about Subpart W and reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process for creating an underground natural gas storage facility. The information provided seems to focus on general GHG reporting requirements for facilities and suppliers, as well as emission factors and component counts for various equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. Further clarification or a refined input related to Subpart W and salt dome mining emissions reporting would be necessary to provide a more targeted analysis.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart.

(h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part.

(2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (c) Content of the annual report. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each annual GHG report shall contain the following information: (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows.

(12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (A) Biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units). (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010. Upon request by the Administrator, the records required under this section must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper documents. You must retain the following records, in addition to those records prescribed in each applicable subpart of this part: (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for which GHG emission were calculated. (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used. For data required by § 98.5(b) to be entered into verification software specified in § 98.5(b), maintain the entered data in the format generated by the verification software according to § 98.5(b). (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (3) The annual GHG reports. (5) A written GHG Monitoring Plan. (i) At a minimum, the GHG Monitoring Plan shall include the elements listed in this paragraph (g)(5)(i). (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (B) Explanation of the processes and methods used to collect the necessary data for the GHG calculations. (C) Description of the procedures and methods that are used for quality assurance, maintenance, and repair of all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (iii) The owner or operator shall revise the GHG Monitoring Plan as needed to reflect changes in production processes, monitoring instrumentation, and quality assurance procedures; or to improve procedures for the maintenance and repair of monitoring systems to reduce the frequency of monitoring equipment downtime. (iv) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall make all information that is collected in conformance with the GHG Monitoring Plan available for review during an audit. Electronic storage of the information in the plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available in hard copy upon request during an audit. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (h) Annual GHG report revisions. This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (3) A substantive error is an error that impacts the quantity of GHG emissions reported or otherwise prevents the reported data from being validated or verified. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions.

However, the provided input does not contain the specific details related to Subpart W Table W-4 or the sections labeled 'Leaker Emission Factors Storage Station, Gas Service' as mentioned in the question.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (i) Electronics Manufacturing (subpart I). (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II).

(iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (4) A change in the GWP for one or more compounds includes the addition to Table A–1 of this subpart of either a chemical-specific or a default GWP that applies to a compound to which no chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart previously applied. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas monitor means an instrument that continuously measures the concentration of a particular gaseous species in the effluent of a stationary source. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Open-ended valve or lines (OELs) means any valve, except pressure relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to atmosphere, either directly or through open piping. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98.

(4) Flares, unless otherwise required by provisions of another subpart of this part to use methodologies in this subpart. (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of this part. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (4) The Tier 4 Calculation Methodology: (E) The installed CEMS include a gas monitor of any kind or a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, or both and the monitors have been certified, either in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (ii) The procedures in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. The CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data for stationary fuel combustion sources shall be monitored as follows: (i) §§ 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (x) For each type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart that was combusted during the report year in the units sharing the common stack or duct during the report year, the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e. (vii) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each fuel type for the units served by the common pipe, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e. (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (F) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions at each monitored location, across all fuel types, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e. (2) For stationary combustion sources using the Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 Calculation Methodologies in § 98.33(a) to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions, the following additional information shall be kept on file and included in the GHG emissions report, where indicated: (f) Each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) subject to reporting under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section must indicate if both of the following two conditions are met: (1) The stationary fuel combustion source contains at least one combustion unit connected to a fuel-fired electric generator owned or operated by an entity that is subject to regulation of customer billing rates by the public utility commission (excluding generators that are connected to combustion units that are subject to subpart D of this part).

In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. Crude oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities. (1) Depending upon the characteristics of the crude stream, it may also include any of the following: (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale.

Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Well workover means the process(es) of performing one or more of a variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas wells to try to increase production.

Calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O (when flared) emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon produced liquids from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities (including stationary liquid storage not owned or operated by the reporter), as specified in this paragraph (j). For gas-liquid separators or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting non-separator equipment (e.g., stabilizers, slug catchers) with annual average daily throughput of oil greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 using Calculation Method 1 or 2 as specified in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section. For wells flowing directly to atmospheric storage tanks without passing through a separator with throughput greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using Calculation Method 2 as specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. For hydrocarbon liquids flowing to gas-liquid separators or non-separator equipment or directly to atmospheric storage tanks with throughput less than 10 barrels per day, use Calculation Method 3 as specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 for separators, you must also calculate emissions that may have occurred due to dump valves not closing properly using the method specified in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a vapor recovery system, you must adjust the emissions downward according to paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. (1) Calculation Method 1. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks. Calculate flashing emissions with a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state, models flashing emissions, and speciates CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that will result when the oil from the separator or non-separator equipment enters an atmospheric pressure storage tank. The following parameters must be determined for typical operating conditions over the year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from liquid transferred to tanks: (iii) Sales oil or stabilized oil API gravity. (iv) Sales oil or stabilized oil production rate. (B) If separator or non-separator equipment oil composition and Reid vapor pressure data are available through your previous analysis, select the latest available analysis that is representative of produced crude oil or condensate from the sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or from the county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. (C) Analyze a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or each county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting for oil composition and Reid vapor pressure using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization. (2) Calculation Method 2. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section for gas-liquid separators with annual average daily throughput of oil greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day. Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section for wells with annual average daily oil production greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day that flow directly to atmospheric storage tanks in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting (if applicable). Calculate annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section for non-separator equipment with annual average daily hydrocarbon liquids throughput greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day that flow directly to atmospheric storage tanks in onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. (i) Flow to storage tank after passing through a separator. Assume that all of the CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 in solution at separator temperature and pressure is emitted from oil sent to storage tanks. You may use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists or you may use an industry standard practice as described in § 98.234(b) to sample and analyze separator oil composition at separator pressure and temperature. (A) If well production oil and gas compositions are available through a previous analysis, select the latest available analysis that is representative of produced oil and gas from the sub-basin category and assume all of the CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 in both oil and gas are emitted from the tank. (B) If well production oil and gas compositions are not available, use default oil and gas compositions in software programs, such as API 4697 E&amp;P Tank, that most closely match the well production gas/oil ratio and API gravity and assume all of the CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 in both oil and gas are emitted from the tank. (4) Determine if the storage tank receiving your separator oil has a vapor recovery system. (k) Transmission storage tanks. For vent stacks connected to one or more transmission condensate storage tanks, either water or hydrocarbon, without vapor recovery, in onshore natural gas transmission compression, calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and CO<E T=""52"">2 annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage as specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of this section. If emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH<E T=""52"">4, CO<E T=""52"">2, and N<E T=""52"">2O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (k)(5) of this section. (1) Determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) of the hydrocarbon production from oil well(s) tested. Determine the production rate from gas well(s) tested. (1) Determine the GOR of the hydrocarbon production from each well whose associated natural gas is vented or flared. If GOR from each well is not available, use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category. (i) For onshore natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, determine the GHG mole fraction using paragraph (u)(2)(i) of this section. (ii) For onshore natural gas processing, when the stream going to flare is natural gas, use the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for all streams upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities. For onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, use the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas liquid for all streams. (10) Method for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from wet seal oil degassing vents at an onshore petroleum and natural gas production facility or an onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facility. You must calculate emissions from centrifugal compressor wet seal oil degassing vents at an onshore petroleum and natural gas production facility or an onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facility using Equation W–25 of this section. (10) Method for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from reciprocating compressor venting at an onshore petroleum and natural gas production facility or an onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facility. You must calculate emissions from reciprocating compressor venting at an onshore petroleum and natural gas production facility or an onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facility using Equation W–29D of this section. (iii) Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must use the appropriate default whole gas leaker emission factors for components in gas service, light crude service, and heavy crude service listed in Table W–1E to this subpart. (iv) Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must use the appropriate default whole gas leaker factors for components in gas service listed in Table W–1E to this subpart. (v) Onshore natural gas processing facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in Table W–2 to this subpart. (vi) Onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in Table W–3A to this subpart. (vii) Underground natural gas storage facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4A to this subpart. (A) Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years “n,” not exceeding a five year period to cover all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of transmission-distribution transfer stations that are monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle.

Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation.

(viii) Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide (subpart RR). (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. Anaerobic lagoon, with respect to subpart JJ of this part, means a type of liquid storage system component that is designed and operated to stabilize wastes using anaerobic microbial processes. Anaerobic lagoons may be designed for combined stabilization and storage with varying lengths of retention time (up to a year or greater), depending on the climate region, volatile solids loading rate, and other operational factors. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator means a device in which a liquid absorbent (including desiccant, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or triethylene glycol) directly contacts a natural gas stream to absorb water vapor. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Delayed coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is produced in a series of closed, batch system reactors. A delayed coking unit consists of the coke drums and ancillary equipment associated with a single fractionator. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Desiccant means a material used in solid-bed dehydrators to remove water from raw natural gas by adsorption or absorption. Desiccants include activated alumina, pelletized calcium chloride, lithium chloride and granular silica gel material. Wet natural gas is passed through a bed of the granular or pelletized solid adsorbent or absorbent in these dehydrators. As the wet gas contacts the surface of the particles of desiccant material, water is adsorbed on the surface or absorbed and dissolves the surface of these desiccant particles. Passing through the entire desiccant bed, almost all of the water is adsorbed onto or absorbed into the desiccant material, leaving the dry gas to exit the contactor. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fluid coking unit means one or more refinery process units in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced in a fluidized bed system. The fluid coking unit includes equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for heat recovery on the fluid coking burner exhaust vent. There are two basic types of fluid coking units: A traditional fluid coking unit in which only a small portion of the coke produced in the unit is burned to fuel the unit and the fluid coking burner exhaust vent is directed to the atmosphere (after processing in a CO boiler or other air pollutant control equipment) and a flexicoking unit in which an auxiliary burner is used to partially combust a significant portion of the produced petroleum coke to generate a low value fuel gas that is used as fuel in other combustion sources at the refinery. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Liberated means released from coal and surrounding rock strata during the mining process. This includes both methane emitted from the ventilation system and methane drained from degasification systems. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Pit storage below animal confinement (deep pits) means the collection and storage of manure typically below a slatted floor in an enclosed animal confinement facility. This usually occurs with little or no added water for periods less than one year. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (8) ASTM D1826–94 (Reapproved 2003) Standard Test Method for Calorific (Heating) Value of Gases in Natural Gas Range by Continuous Recording Calorimeter, IBR approved for § 98.254(e).

You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). (i) Use Equation C–1 except when natural gas billing records are used to quantify fuel usage and gas consumption is expressed in units of therms or million Btu. In that case, use Equation C–1a or C–1b, as applicable. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation. (i) Use Equation C–8a to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms. (ii) Use Equation C–8b to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu. (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (i) The total quantity of the fuel combusted during the report year in the units sharing the fuel supply is measured, either at the “gate” to the facility or at a point inside the facility, using a fuel flow meter, billing meter, or tank drop measurements (as applicable); (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. (4) Annual natural gas usage (therms/year) (Equation C–1a of § 98.33). (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33).

(6) All fluorinated GHGs and N<E T=""52"">2O consumed. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (i) For containers with a maximum storage capacity of less than 9.08 kg (20 lbs) of gas, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 50 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type. (3) If you use default destruction and removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), you must certify and document that the abatement systems at your facility for which you use default destruction or removal efficiency values are specifically designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. If you elect to calculate fluorinated GHG emissions using the stack test method under § 98.93(i), you must also certify that you have included and accounted for all abatement systems designed for fluorinated GHG abatement and any respective downtime in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(i)(3).

(4) As part of normal operations for each fab, the inventory of gas stored in containers at the beginning of the reporting year must be the same as the inventory of gas stored in containers at the end of the previous reporting year. You must maintain records documenting the year end and year beginning inventories under § 98.97(a).

Additionally, the document specifies calculation methodologies, quality assurance requirements for monitoring equipment, and reporting procedures for different types of fuel combustion sources. However, it does not directly address the specific question about reporting requirements for leaking liquefied natural gas facility equipment listed in Table W-5. The information provided in the input seems to be incomplete and does not offer a direct answer to the question posed.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (iv) Supporting documentation showing that it is not practicable to isolate the process equipment or unit and install the measurement device without a full shutdown or a hot tap, and that there was no opportunity during 2010 to install the device. Include the date of the three most recent shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, the frequency of shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, and the date of the next planned process equipment or unit shutdown. Absorbent circulation pump means a pump commonly powered by natural gas pressure that circulates the absorbent liquid between the absorbent regenerator and natural gas contactor. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. Centrifugal compressor means any equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by centrifugal action, employing rotating movement of the driven shaft. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. De-methanizer means the natural gas processing unit that separates methane rich residue gas from the heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus) in feed natural gas stream. Destruction device, for the purposes of subparts II and TT of this part, means a flare, thermal oxidizer, boiler, turbine, internal combustion engine, or any other combustion unit used to destroy or oxidize methane contained in landfill gas or wastewater biogas. Direct liquefaction means the conversion of coal directly into liquids, rather than passing through an intermediate gaseous state. Emergency equipment means any auxiliary fossil fuel-powered equipment, such as a fire pump, that is used only in emergency situations. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas means gas generated at a petroleum refinery or petrochemical plant and that is combusted separately or in any combination with any type of gas. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. High-bleed pneumatic devices are automated, continuous bleed flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate in excess of 6 standard cubic feet per hour. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. (4) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous into U.S. jurisdiction exclusively for U. S. military purposes. Intermittent bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for automatically maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. These are snap-acting or throttling devices that discharge all or a portion of the full volume of the actuator intermittently when control action is necessary, but does not bleed continuously. Liberated means released from coal and surrounding rock strata during the mining process. This includes both methane emitted from the ventilation system and methane drained from degasification systems. Low-bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate equal to or less than six standard cubic feet per hour. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas driven pneumatic pump means a pump that uses pressurized natural gas to move a piston or diaphragm, which pumps liquids on the opposite side of the piston or diaphragm. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Natural gasoline means a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons (mostly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons) extracted from natural gas. It includes isopentane. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. (3) The equipment is located at a seasonal facility and operates during the full annual operating period of the seasonal facility, remains at the facility for at least two years, and operates at that facility for at least three months each year. Reciprocating compressor means a piece of equipment that increases the pressure of a process natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 by positive displacement, employing linear movement of a shaft driving a piston in a cylinder. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” (10) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography, IBR approved for § 98.74(c), § 98.164(b), § 98.244(b), § 98.254(d), § 98.324(d), § 98.354(g), and § 98.344(b).

If appendix F to part 60 of this chapter is selected for on-going quality assurance, perform daily calibration drift assessments for both the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and the flow rate monitor, conduct cylinder gas audits of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor in three of the four quarters of each year (except for non-operating quarters), and perform annual RATAs of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and the CERMS. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with § 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with § 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (f) Each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) subject to reporting under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section must indicate if both of the following two conditions are met: (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. (5) Annual natural gas usage (mmBtu/year) (Equation C–1b of § 98.33). (a) For each electricity generating unit that is subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program or is otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under this subpart the annual mass emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CH<E T=""52"">4 by following the requirements of this subpart. (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains an adipic acid production process and the facility meets the requirements of either § 98.2(a)(1) or (2). (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (ii) You must notify the EPA of your use of a previously approved alternative method ",,1,The provided input does not directly address the specific question about reporting requirements for leaking liquefied natural gas facility equipment listed in Table W-5.

However, it does not directly provide a specific calculation methodology for operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–3 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Tables A–3 and A–4 of this subpart. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (1) Calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is imported and the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is exported during the year. (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (G) For each reported fluorinated GHG and fluorinated heat transfer fluid, report the following identifying information: (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used. For data required by § 98.5(b) to be entered into verification software specified in § 98.5(b), maintain the entered data in the format generated by the verification software according to § 98.5(b). (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (B) Explanation of the processes and methods used to collect the necessary data for the GHG calculations. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Liberated means released from coal and surrounding rock strata during the mining process. This includes both methane emitted from the ventilation system and methane drained from degasification systems. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas.

(c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (iii) For a gaseous fuel, use Equation C–5 of this section. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (ii) When the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration is measured on a wet basis, Equation C–6 of this section is used to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 emission rates: (v) Each hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack. (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (A) At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if necessary) Method 4 in appendices A–2 and A–3 to part 60 of this chapter to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 3A tests are required, to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration. A Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate (e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded during the test. (B) Calculate a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate (in metric tons/hr) from the stack test data, using a version of Equation C–6 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, modified as follows. In the Equation C–6 nomenclature, replace the words “Hourly average” in the definitions of “C<E T=""52"">CO2” and “Q” with the words “3-run average”. Substitute the arithmetic average values of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate from the emission testing into modified Equation C–6. If CO<E T=""52"">2 is measured on a dry basis, a moisture correction of the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate is required. Use Equation C–7 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section to make this correction; replace the word “Hourly” with the words “3-run average” in the equation nomenclature. (C) The results of each annual stack test shall be used in the GHG emissions calculations for the year of the test. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate at each set point. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (G) Finally, add the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the unit. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Use the hourly heat input data from appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, together with Equation G–4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates, in units of tons/hr; (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, ",,,,1,"The answer does not provide a clear evaluation rating for whether the answer is entailed by the context. Instead, it provides a summary of the information contained in the context, including calculation methodologies and reporting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions.

Therefore, further specific guidance or regulations related to offshore LNG terminals may need to be consulted to determine the GHG reporting applicability for such facilities.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (E) Each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), except fluorinated gas production facilities must comply with § 98.126(a) rather than this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E). If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (G) For each reported fluorinated GHG and fluorinated heat transfer fluid, report the following identifying information: (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (3) The annual GHG reports. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (h) Annual GHG report revisions. This paragraph applies to the reporting years for which the owner or operator is required to maintain records for a facility or supplier according to the time periods specified in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. (4) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous into U.S. jurisdiction exclusively for U. S. military purposes. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Re-condenser means heat exchangers that cool compressed boil-off gas to a temperature that will condense natural gas to a liquid. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. (2) GPA 2261–00 Analysis for Natural Gas and Similar Gaseous Mixtures by Gas Chromatography, IBR approved for § 98.164(b), § 98.254(d), § 98.344(b), and § 98.354(g). You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (iii) If, for a particular type of fuel, sampling and analysis for carbon content and molecular weight is performed more often than the minimum frequency specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the results of all valid fuel analyses shall be used in the GHG emission calculations. (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under § 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level or process-level data specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, as applicable, for each stationary fuel combustion source (e.g., individual unit, aggregation of units, common pipe, or common stack) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a). For the data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, the owner or operator of a stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section may elect either to report the data specified in this sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to § 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source. (1) Aggregation of units. If a facility contains two or more units (e.g., boilers or combustion turbines), each of which has a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less, you may report the combined GHG emissions for the group of units in lieu of reporting GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the use of Tier 4 is not required or elected for any of the units and the units use the same tier for any common fuels combusted. If this option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more electricity generating units and the facility meets the requirements of § 98.2(a)(1). Follow the applicable quality assurance procedures for CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in appendices B, D, and G to 40 CFR part 75. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains an ammonia manufacturing process and the facility meets the requirements of either § 98.2(a)(1) or (2). (2) Liquid feedstock. You must calculate, from each ammonia manufacturing unit, the CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from liquid feedstock according to Equation G–2 of this section: (4) You must calculate the annual process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from each ammonia processing unit k at your facility according to Equation G–4 of this section: (5) You must determine the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from all ammonia processing units at your facility using Equation G–5 of this section. (c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (3) If you manufacture PVs, you must calculate annual production process emissions of each input gas i for threshold applicability purposes using gas-appropriate GWP values shown in Table A–1 to subpart A of this part and Equation I–3 of this subpart. (1) Fluorinated GHGs emitted. (6) All fluorinated GHGs and N<E T=""52"">2O consumed. (c) You must calculate total annual input gas i consumption on a fab basis for each fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O using Equation I–11 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–11 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account for the anticipated change in your preliminary estimate. You may account for such a change using a quantifiable metric (e.g., the ratio of the number of tools that are expected to be vented to the stack system in the current year as compared to the previous reporting year, ratio of the expected number of wafer starts in the current reporting year as compared to the previous reporting year), engineering judgment, or other industry standard practice. (i) The sum of annual emissions of fluorinated GHGs from all of the combined stack systems that are not tested in the fab must be less than 10,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. (iii) Fluorinated GHG emissions from each of the stack systems that is not tested can only be attributed to particular process tools during the test (that is, the stack system that is not tested cannot be used as an alternative emission point or bypass stack system from other process tools not attributed to the untested stack system). (iii) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG input gas consumed (in kg of fluorinated GHG emitted per kg of input gas i consumed) in the tools that vent to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–19 of this subpart. If the emissions of input gas i exceed the consumption of input gas i during the sampling period, then equate “E<E T=""52"">is” to the consumption of input gas i and treat the difference between the emissions and consumption of input gas i as a by-product of the other input gases, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. (i) Calculate emissions from consumption of each intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG as defined in § 98.98 of this subpart using the default utilization and by-product formation rates and equations specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. If a fluorinated GHG was not being used during the stack testing and does not meet the definition of intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG in § 98.98, then you must test the stack systems associated with the use of that fluorinated GHG at a time when that gas is in use at a magnitude that would allow you to determine an emission factor for that gas according to the procedures specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (1) You must demonstrate that the fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O apportioning factors are developed using calculations that are repeatable, as defined in § 98.98. (ii) You must compare the actual gas consumed to the modeled gas consumed for one fluorinated GHG reported under this subpart for the fab. You must certify that the fluorinated GHG selected for comparison corresponds to the largest quantity, on a mass basis, of fluorinated GHG consumed at the fab during the reporting year for which you are required to apportion following the procedures specified in § 98.93(a), (b), or (i). You may compare the actual gas consumed to the modeled gas consumed for two fluorinated GHGs and demonstrate conformance according to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section on an aggregate use basis for both fluorinated GHGs if one of the fluorinated GHGs selected for comparison corresponds to the largest quantity, on a mass basis, of fluorinated GHGs used at each fab that requires apportionment during the reporting year. (v) If your facility has multiple fabs with a single centralized fluorinated-GHG supply system, you must verify that your apportioning model can apportion fl",,1,"The provided input contains information related to GHG reporting requirements, including specific thresholds for emissions, calculation methodologies, and definitions of terms related to natural gas, petroleum products, and industrial greenhouse gases.

For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence.

(c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year.

(g) If a capacity or generation reporting threshold in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies, the owner or operator shall review the appropriate records and perform any necessary calculations to determine whether the threshold has been exceeded. (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to the rule and reporting requirements, if a facility or supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at a later time pursuant to § 98.3(b)(3). Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, and facility expansion. (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future year. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part.

Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (c) Content of the annual report. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each annual GHG report shall contain the following information: (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows.

If a fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member. (F) For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) that is not also a fluorinated GHG as specified under (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section. If a fluorinated heat transfer fluid does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart, identify and report the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated heat transfer fluid is a member.

Parameters include not only reported data elements, but any data element required for monitoring and calculating emissions. (vii) If the facility or supplier is a federally owned facility, report “U.S. Government” and do not report physical address or percent ownership. (viii) The facility or supplier must refer to the reporting instructions of the electronic GHG reporting tool regarding standardized conventions for the naming of a parent company.

(d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of a relevant subpart. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31, 2010. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process unit shutdown. Include the date of the most recent process unit shutdown, the frequency of shutdowns for this process unit, and the date of the next planned shutdown during which the monitoring equipment can be installed. If there has been a shutdown or if there is a planned process unit shutdown between promulgation of this part and April 1, 2010, include a justification of why the equipment could not be obtained and installed during that shutdown. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1, 2010. The use of best available methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2010. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph (g). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, retain all required records for at least 3 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated. The records shall be kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. If the owner or operator of a facility is required under § 98.5(b) to use verification software specified by the Administrator, then all records required for the facility under this part must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of submission of the annual GHG report for the reporting year in which the record was generated, starting with records for reporting year 2010. Upon request by the Administrator, the records required under this section must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper documents. You must retain the following records, in addition to those records prescribed in each applicable subpart of this part: (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for which GHG emission were calculated. (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type.

(d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (xii) Imports and Exports of Equipment Pre-charged with Fluorinated GHGs or Containing Fluorinated GHGs in Closed-cell Foams (subpart QQ). (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions mean natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a dry seal vent pipe and/or the seal face around the rotating shaft where it exits one or both ends of the compressor case. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Direct liquefaction means the conversion of coal directly into liquids, rather than passing through an intermediate gaseous state. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. (2) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide into the U.S. from Mexico where the fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide had been admitted into Mexico in bond and were of U.S. origin. (3) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide into the U.S. when transported in a consignment of personal or household effects or in a similar non-commercial situation normally exempted from U.S. Customs attention. (4) Bringing fluorinated GHGs or nitrous into U.S. jurisdiction exclusively for U. S. military purposes. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Non-crude feedstocks means any petroleum product or natural gas liquid that enters the refinery to be further refined or otherwise used on site. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Transshipment means the continuous shipment of nitrous oxide or a fluorinated GHG from a foreign state of origin through the United States or its territories to a second foreign state of final destination, as long as the shipment does not enter into United States jurisdiction. A transshipment, as it moves through the United States or its territories, cannot be re-packaged, sorted or otherwise changed in condition. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas.

(viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (A) At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if necessary) Method 4 in appendices A–2 and A–3 to part 60 of this chapter to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 3A tests are required, to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration. A Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate (e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded during the test. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met. (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following three conditions are met: First, a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS (or a surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions (either according to part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit during the reporting year; and third, the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent emissions included). (iv) If the combustion of MSW and/or tires provides no more than 10 percent of the annual heat input to a unit, or if a small, batch incinerator combusts no more than 1,000 tons per year of MSW, you may estimate the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions as follows, in lieu of following the procedures in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section: (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (2) Monitored common stack or duct configurations. When the flue gases from two or more stationary fuel combustion units at a facility are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere and if CEMS are used to continuously monitor CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions at the common stack or duct according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, you may report the combined emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units. This monitoring and reporting alternative may also be used when process off-gases or a mixture of combustion products and process gases are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere. Whenever the common stack or duct monitoring option is applied, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section: (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that: (viii) If CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that are generated from acid gas scrubbing with sorbent injection are not captured using CEMS, report: (2) The stationary fuel combustion source is located at a facility for which the sum of the nameplate capacities for all electric generators specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is greater than or equal to 1 megawatt electric output. (b) For each electricity generating unit that is not subject to the Acid Rain Program or otherwise required to monitor and report to EPA CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions year-round according to 40 CFR part 75, you must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O by following the requirements of subpart C. (a) You must report N<E T=""52"">2O process emissions at the facility level. (1) You must conduct the test on the vent stream from the nitric acid oxidation step of the process, referred to as the test point, according to the methods specified in § 98.54(b) through (f). If multiple adipic acid production units exhaust to a common abatement technology and/or emission point, you must sample each process in the ducts before the emissions are combined, sample each process when only one process is operating, or sample the combined emissions when multiple processes are operating and base the site-specific emission factor on the combined production rate of the multiple adipic acid production units. (3) Calculate the destruction efficiency by conducting an additional performance test on the vent stream following the N<E T=""52"">2O abatement technology. (i) You must determine the amount of process N<E T=""52"">2O emissions that is sold or transferred off site (if applicable). You can determine the amount using existing process flow meters and N<E T=""52"">2O analyzers. You must report: (c) CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from on-site anode baking. (1) Use Equation F–7 of this section to calculate emissions from pitch volatiles combustion. (g) If process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from anode consumption during electrolysis or anode baking of prebake cells are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall not be used to calculate those process emissions. The owner or operation shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). (a) CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from steam reforming of a hydrocarbon or the gasification of solid and liquid raw material, reported for each ammonia manufacturing process unit following the requirements of this subpart (CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions reported under this subpart may include CO<E T=""52"">2 that is later consumed on site for urea production, and therefore is not released to the ambient air from the ammonia manufacturing process unit). (b) CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit. You must report these emissions under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), by following the requirements of subpart C, except that for ammonia manufacturing processes subpart C does not apply to any CO<E T=""52"">2 resulting from combustion of the waste recycle stream (commonly referred to as the purge gas stream). (c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (b) CO<E T=""52"">2 combustion emissions from each kiln. (5) Emissions of fluorinated heat transfer fluids. (b) You must calculate annual fab-level N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from all chemical vapor deposition processes and from the aggregate of all other electronics manufacturing production processes using Equation I–10 of this subpart and the methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. If your fab uses less than 50 kg of N<E T=""52"">2O in one reporting year, you may calculate fab emissions as equal to your fab's annual consumption for N<E T=""52"">2O as calculated in Equation I–11 of this subpart. (i) When you are calculating preliminary estimates for the purpose of this paragraph (i)(1), you must consider the subscript “j” in Equations I–8 and I–9, and I–13 of this subpart to mean “stack system” instead of “process sub-type or process type.” For the value of a<E T=""52"">ij, the fraction of input gas i that is used in tools with abatement systems, for use in Equations I–8 and I–9, you may use the ratio of the number of tools using input gas i that have abatement systems that are vented to the stack system for which you are calculating the preliminary estimate to the total number of tools using input gas i that are vented to that stack system, expressed as a decimal fraction. In calculating the preliminary estimates, you must account for the effect of any fluorinated GHG abatement system meeting the definition of abatement system in § 98.98. You may use this approach to determining a<E T=""52"">ij only for this preliminary estimate. (iii) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG input gas consumed (in kg of fluorinated GHG emitted per kg of input gas i consumed) in the tools that vent to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–19 of this subpart. If the emissions of input gas i exceed the consumption of input gas i during the sampling period, then equate “E<E T=""52"">is” to the consumption of input gas i and treat the difference between the emissions and consumption of input gas i as a by-product of the other input gases, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. (iv) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG formed as a by-product (in kg of fluorinated GHG per kg of total fluorinated GHG consumed) in the tools vented to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. When calculating the by-product emission factor for an input gas for which emissions exceeded its consumption, exclude the consumption of that input gas from the term “∑(Activity<E T=""52"">if).” (ii) Calculate emissions from consumption of each fluorinated GHG used in tools vented to stack systems that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (i)(2)(iii) of this section, and were not tested according to the procedures in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Calculate emissions using the default utilization and by-product formation rates and equations specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. If you are using a fluorinated GHG not listed in Tables I–11, I–12, I–13, I–14, or I–15 of this subpart, then you must assume utilization and by-product formation rates of zero for that fluorinated GHG. (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (i) For containers with a maximum storage capacity of less than 9.08 kg (20 lbs) of gas, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 50 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type. (3) If you use default destruction and removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), you must certify and document that the abatement systems at your facility for which you use default destruction or removal efficiency values are specifically designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. If you elect to calculate fluorinated GHG emissions using the stack test method under § 98.93(i), you must also certify that you have included and accounted for all abatement systems designed for fluorinated GHG abatement and any respective downtime in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(i)(3). (vi) If your fab uses redundant abatement systems, you may account for the total abatement system uptime (that is, the time that at least one abatement system is in operational mode) calculated for a specific exhaust stream during the reporting year. (i) You must conduct an emission test during which the fab is operating at a representative operating level, as defined in § 98.98, and with the abatement systems connected to the stack system being tested operating with at least 90 percent uptime, averaged over all abatement systems, during the 8-hour (or longer) period for each stack system, or at no less than 90 percent of the abatement system uptime rate measured over the previous reporting year, averaged over all abatement systems. (ii) You must measure for the expected and possible by-products identified in Table I–17 of this subpart and those fluorinated GHGs used as input fluorinated GHG in process tools vented to the stack system, except for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG as defined in § 98.98. You must calculate annual emissions of intermittent low-use fluorinated GHGs by adhering to the procedures in § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (3) If you use default destruction or removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), certification that the abatement systems for which emissions are being reported were specifically designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. You must support this certification by providing abatement system supplier documentation stating that the system was designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. (iii) If you use default destruction or removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), certification that the abatement systems for which emissions are being reported were specifically designed for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as required under § 98.94(f)(3), and certification that the site maintenance plan includes manufacturer's recommendations and specifications for installation, operation, and maintenance for all applicable abatement systems. (iii) A description of the tool, with the process type or sub-type, for which the abatement system treats exhaust. Input gas means a fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O used in one of the processes described in § 98.90(a)(1) through (4) (c) If GHG emissions from an EAF are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. (2) Each fluorinated gas transformation process that is not part of a fluorinated gas production process and where no fluorinated GHG reactant is produced at another facility. (3) Each fluorinated gas transformation process that is not part of a fluorinated gas production process and where one or more fluorinated GHG reactants are produced at another facility. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (1) Preliminary estimate of emissions by process vent. You must estimate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions of fluorinated GHGs for each process vent within each operating scenario of a continuous process using the approaches specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, accounting for any destruction as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. You must determine emissions of fluorinated GHGs by process vent by using measurements, by using calculations based on chemical engineering principles and chemical property data, or by conducting an engineering assessment. You may use previous measurements, calculations, and assessments if they represent current process operating conditions or process operating conditions that would result in higher fluorinated GHG emissions than the current operating conditions and if they were performed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, as applicable. You must document all data, assumptions, and procedures used in the calculations or engineering assessment and keep a record of the emissions determination as required by § 98.127(a). (i) Engineering calculations. For process vent emission calculations, you may use any of paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A), (c)(1)(i)(B), or (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section. (1) To calculate emissions caused by the heating of a vessel without a process condenser to a temperature lower than the bo",,1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question about reporting boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank.,1,"The given input contains information about emissions from various sources, but it does not provide any relevant information about reporting boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.0,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,3,"The answer partially addresses the question but lacks coherence. It contains information about emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, but does not directly answer the question about reporting boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank.",465,,
106,,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emissions from the data. It specifies the emission thresholds for different types of facilities and the reporting schedule. Additionally, it provides details on the calculation of GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products and natural gas liquids. However, it does not explicitly mention whether natural gas distribution facilities are required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulators under §98.232(i). The tables provided include emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S. regions, leaker emission factors, and total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression. These tables are essential for understanding the emission calculation methodologies and thresholds mentioned in the document.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using any of the four calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a). Calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the stationary fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in § 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but include emissions of CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O from biomass combustion. (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified in subpart U of this part. (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e using Equation A–1 of this section. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. (j) Table A–2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) For reporting year 2011, facilities with one or more of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section and suppliers listed in paragraph (b)(1)(xii) of this section are required to submit their annual GHG report no later than September 28, 2012. Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (6) A written explanation, as required under § 98.3(e), if you change emission calculation methodologies during the reporting period. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iii) Date of submittal. (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (3) The annual GHG reports. (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (iii) The owner or operator shall revise the GHG Monitoring Plan as needed to reflect changes in production processes, monitoring instrumentation, and quality assurance procedures; or to improve procedures for the maintenance and repair of monitoring systems to reduce the frequency of monitoring equipment downtime. (1) The owner or operator shall submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct all substantive errors. (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified error is not a substantive error. (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to support any revision made to an annual GHG report. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator has received a complete certificate of representation under this section for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial emission report under this part. (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission report and any other submission under this part for a facility or supplier shall be certified, signed, and submitted by the designated representative or any alternate designated representative of the facility or supplier in accordance with this section and § 3.10 of this chapter. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. City gate means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iii) Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. (2) Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their energy or chemical content. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Ex refinery gate means the point at which a petroleum product leaves the refinery. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. Gas collection system or landfill gas collection system means a system of pipes used to collect landfill gas from different locations in the landfill by means of a fan or similar mechanical draft equipment (forced convection) to a single location for treatment (thermal destruction) or use. Landfill gas collection systems may also include knock-out or separator drums and/or a compressor. A single landfill may have multiple gas collection systems. Landfill gas collection systems do not include “passive” systems, whereby landfill gas flows naturally (without forced convection) to the surface of the landfill where an opening or pipe (vent) is installed to allow for the flow of landfill gas to the atmosphere or to a remote flare installed to combust landfill gas that is passively emitted from the vent. Landfill gas collection systems also do not include “active venting” systems, whereby landfill gas is conveyed to the surface of the landfill using forced convection, but the landfill gas is never recovered or thermally destroyed prior to release to the atmosphere. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field quality or pipeline quality. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) means those hydrocarbons in natural gas that are separated from the gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGLs refers to mixtures of NGLs that are sold or delivered as undifferentiated product from natural gas processing plants. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Reporting year means the calendar year during which the GHG data are required to be collected for purposes of the annual GHG report. For example, reporting year 2014 is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the annual report for reporting year 2014 is submitted to EPA on March 31, 2015. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sour natural gas means natural gas that contains significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S)and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Vaporization unit means a process unit that performs controlled heat input to vaporize LNG to supply transmission and distribution pipelines or consumers with natural gas. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a natural gas dehydrator is referred to as “wet gas.” You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98.

Facilities and suppliers that are submitting their second annual GHG report in 2012 and that are reporting on one or more subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xii) of this section must notify EPA by March 31, 2012 that they are not required to submit their annual GHG report until September 28, 2012. (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (vii) The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–6 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2011 until March 31, 2013. The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements specified in Table A–7 of this subpart for calendar years 2010 through 2013 until March 31, 2015 (as part of the annual report for reporting year 2014), except as otherwise specified in Table A–7 of this subpart. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31, 2010. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (3) Timing of request. (i) The initial notice of intent must be submitted no later than January 1, 2011, or by the end of the approved use of best available monitoring methods extension in 2010, whichever is earlier. The completed extension request must be submitted to the Administrator no later than February 15, 2011. (6) Measurement device installation deadline. Any owner or operator that submits both a timely initial notice of intent and a timely completed extension request under paragraph (j)(3) of this section to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by July 1, 2011 unless the extension request under this paragraph (j) is approved by the Administrator before July 1, 2011. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. The use of best available methods under this paragraph (l) will not be approved beyond December 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published.

(A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required (i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least four months apart). In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (n) of this section at the facility level. (c) Number of facility and unit operating hours in calendar year. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), you must report the following information at the facility level: (4) Multiple semiconductor manufacturing facilities may submit a single consolidated 3-year report as long as the facility identifying information in § 98.3(c)(1) and the certification statement in § 98.3(c)(9) is provided for each facility for which the consolidated report is submitted. (6) The Administrator will review the reports within 120 days and will notify you of a determination whether it is necessary to update any default utilization and by-product formation rates and/or destruction or removal efficiency values. If the Administrator determines it is necessary to update default utilization and by-product formation rates and/or destruction or removal efficiency values, you will then have 180 days from the date you receive notice of the determination to execute the data collection and analysis plan described in the report and submit those data to the Administrator. (d) Calculate fluorinated GHG emissions for equipment leaks (EL). If you comply with paragraph (c) of this section, you must calculate the fluorinated GHG emissions from pieces of equipment associated with processes covered under this subpart and in fluorinated GHG service. If you conduct monitoring of equipment in fluorinated GHG service, monitoring must be conducted for those in light liquid and in gas and vapor service. If you conduct monitoring of equipment in fluorinated GHG service, you may exclude from monitoring each piece of equipment that is difficult-to-monitor, that is unsafe-to-monitor, that is insulated, or that is in heavy liquid service; you may exclude from monitoring each pump with dual mechanical seals, agitator with dual mechanical seals, pump with no external shaft, agitator with no external shaft; you may exclude from monitoring each pressure relief device in gas and vapor service with upstream rupture disk, each sampling connection system with closed-loop or closed-purge systems, and any pieces of equipment where leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device. You must estimate emissions using another approach for those pieces of equipment excluded from monitoring. Equipment that is in fluorinated GHG service for less than 300 hr/yr; equipment that is in vacuum service; pressure relief devices that are in light liquid service; and instrumentation systems are exempted from these requirements. (ii) Use of Other Approaches in EPA Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates in conjunction with EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using one of the following methods in EPA–453/R–95–017 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7): The Screening Ranges Approach; the EPA Correlation Approach; or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach. If you determine that EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7 is appropriate for monitoring a fluorinated GHG, and if you calibrate your instrument with a compound different from one or more of the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates to be measured, you must develop response factors for each fluorinated GHG or for each surrogate to be measured using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7. For each fluorinated GHG or surrogate measured, the response factor must be less than 10. The response factor is the ratio of the known concentration of a fluorinated GHG or surrogate to the observed meter reading when measured using an instrument calibrated with the reference compound. (iii) Use of Other Approaches in EPA Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates in conjunction with site-specific leak monitoring methods. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using one of the following methods in EPA–453/R–95–017 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7): The Screening Ranges Approach; the EPA Correlation Approach; or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach. You may develop a site-specific leak monitoring method appropriate for monitoring fluorinated GHGs or surrogates to use along with these three approaches. The site-specific leak monitoring method must meet the requirements in § 98.124(f)(1). (iv) Use of site-specific leak monitoring methods. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using a site-specific leak monitoring method. The site-specific leak monitoring method must meet the requirements in § 98.124(f)(1). (2) You must collect information on the number of each type of equipment; the service of each piece of equipment (gas, light liquid, heavy liquid); the concentration of each fluorinated GHG in the stream; and the time period each piece of equipment was in service. Depending on which approach you follow, you may be required to collect information for equipment on the associated screening data concentrations for greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv and associated screening data concentrations for less than 10,000 ppmv; associated actual screening data concentrations; or associated screening data and leak rate data (i.e., bagging) used to develop a unit-specific correlation. (f) Emission monitoring for pieces of equipment. If you conduct a site-specific leak detection method or monitoring approach for pieces of equipment, follow paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section and follow paragraph (f)(3) of this section. (1) Site-specific leak monitoring approach. You may develop a site-specific leak monitoring approach. You must validate the leak monitoring method and describe the method and the validation in the GHG Monitoring Plan. To validate the site-specific method, you may, for example, release a known rate of the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates of interest, or you may compare the results of the site-specific method to those of a method that has been validated for the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates of interest. In the description of the leak detection method and its validation, include a detailed description of the method, including the procedures and equipment used and any sampling strategies. Also include the rationale behind the method, including why the method is expected to result in an unbiased estimate of emissions from equipment leaks. If the method is based on methods that are used to detect or quantify leaks or other emissions in other regulations, standards, or guidelines, identify and describe the regulations, standards, or guidelines and why their methods are applicable to emissions of fluorinated GHGs or surrogates from leaks. Account for possible sources of error in the method, e.g., instrument detection limits, measurement biases, and sampling biases. Describe validation efforts, including but not limited to any comparisons against standard leaks or concentrations, any comparisons against other methods, and their results. If you use the Screening Ranges Approach, the EPA Correlation Approach, or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach with a monitoring instrument that does not meet all of the specifications in EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7, then explain how and why the monitoring instrument, as used at your facility, would nevertheless be expected to accurately detect and quantify emissions of fluorinated GHGs or surrogates from process equipment, and describe how you verified its accuracy. For all methods, provide a quantitative estimate of the accuracy and precision of the method. (3) Frequency of measurement and sampling. If you estimate emissions based on monitoring of equipment, conduct monitoring at least annually. Sample at least one-third of equipment annually (except for equipment that is unsafe-to-monitor, difficult-to-monitor, insulated, or in heavy liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with an upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment whose leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device), changing the sample each year such that at the end of three years, all equipment in the process has been monitored. If you estimate emissions based on a sample of the equipment in the process, ensure that the sample is representative of the equipment in the process. If you have multiple processes that have similar types of equipment in similar service, and that produce or transform similar fluorinated GHGs (in terms of chemical composition, molecular weight, and vapor pressure) at similar pressures and concentrations, then you may annually sample all of the equipment in one third of these processes rather than one third of the equipment in each process. (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be purchased, delivered, or installed before July 1, 2011, include supporting documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was ordered, investigation of alternative suppliers, the dates by which alternative vendors promised delivery or installation, backorder notices or unexpected delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery or installation, and the current expected date of delivery or installation. (E) If the reason for the extension is that service providers were unable to provide necessary measurement services, include supporting documentation demonstrating that these services could not be acquired before July 1, 2011. This documentation must include written correspondence to and from at least two service providers stating that they will not be able to provide the necessary services before July 1, 2011. (1) Timing. The owner or operator of a facility is not required to report the data elements at § 98.3(c)(4)(iii) and paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of this section until the later of March 31, 2015 or the date set forth for that data element at § 98.3(c)(4)(vii) and Table A–7 of Subpart A of this part. (f) Equipment leak records. If you are subject to § 98.123(d) of this subpart, you must maintain information on the number of each type of equipment; the service of each piece of equipment (gas, light liquid, heavy liquid); the concentration of each fluorinated GHG in the stream; each piece of equipment excluded from monitoring requirement; the time period each piece of equipment was in service, and the emission calculations for each fluorinated GHG for all processes. Depending on which equipment leak monitoring approach you follow, you must maintain information for equipment on the associated screening data concentrations for greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv and associated screening data concentrations for less than 10,000 ppmv; associated actual screening data concentrations; and associated screening data and leak rate data (i.e., bagging) used to develop a unit-specific correlation. If you developed and follow a site-specific leak detection approach, provide the records for monitoring events and the emissions estimation calculations, as appropriate, consistent with the approach for equipment leak emission estimation in your GHG Monitoring Plan. (i) The number of sources of equipment type t with screening values greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv shall be determined using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7, and defining a leak as follows: (1) A leak source that could emit HFC–23, and (2) A leak source at whose surface a concentration of fluorocarbons equal to or greater than 10,000 ppm is measured. (a) For calendar year 2011 monitoring, the facility may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods as listed in § 98.3(d)(1)(i) through (iv). The request must be submitted no later than October 12, 2010 and must contain the information in § 98.3(d)(2)(ii). To obtain approval, the request must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2011. The use of best available monitoring methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2011. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each annual report must include the following information at the facility level: In addition to the records specified in § 98.3(g), you must retain the following information at the facility level: (7) Equipment leaks from valves, connectors, open ended lines, pressure relief valves, and meters. (7) Equipment leaks from valves, connectors, open ended lines, pressure relief valves, and meters. (8) Equipment leaks from all other components that are not listed in paragraph (e)(1), (2), or (7) of this section and are either subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a of this chapter or you elect to survey using a leak detection method described in § 98.234(a)(6) or (7). The other components subject to this paragraph (e)(8) also do not include thief hatches or other openings on a storage vessel. If these other components are not subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a of this chapter, you may also elect to report emissions from these other components if you elect to survey them using a leak detection method described in § 98.234(a)(1) through (5). (5) Equipment leaks from valves, connectors, open ended lines, pressure relief valves, and meters associated with storage stations. (6) Equipment leaks from all other components that are associated with storage stations, are not listed in paragraph (f)(1), (2), or (5) of this section, and are either subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a of this chapter or you elect to survey using a leak detection method described in § 98.234(a)(6) or (7). If these other components are not subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a of this chapter, you may also elect to report emissions from these other components if you elect to survey them using a leak detection method described in § 98.234(a)(1) through (5). (7) Equipment leaks from valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves associated with storage wellheads. (8) Equipment leaks from all other components that are associated with storage wellheads, are not listed in paragraph (f)(1), (2), or (7) of this section, and are either subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a, of this chapter or you elect to survey using a leak detection method described in § 98.234(a)(6) or (7).

(2) LDCs shall either substitute their delivering pipeline metered deliveries at the city gate or substitute nominations and scheduled delivery quantities for the period when metered values of actual deliveries are not available. (3) A strategy for detecting and quantifying any surface leakage of CO<E T=""52"">2. Equipment leak means those emissions that could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally-equivalent opening. Surface leakage means the movement of the injected CO<E T=""52"">2 stream from the injection zone to the surface, and into the atmosphere, indoor air, oceans, or surface water. (e) Electrical equipment manufacturers and refurbishers must account for SF<E T=""52"">6 or PFC emissions that occur as a result of unexpected events or accidental losses, such as a malfunctioning hose or leak in the flow line, during the filling of equipment or containers for disbursement by including these losses in the estimated mass of SF<E T=""52"">6 or the PFC emitted downstream of the container or flowmeter during the period p.

(iii) The use of this reporting option is documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). Indicate in the Monitoring Plan which units share the common fuel supply and the method used to demonstrate that this alternative reporting option applies. For the small combustion sources, a description of the types of units and the approximate number of units is sufficient. (A) For the first 2 years for which your fab is required to report emissions of fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O, for each abatement system gas and process sub-type or process type combination, as applicable, a random sample of a minimum of 10 percent of installed abatement systems must be tested annually for a total of a minimum of 20 percent, or a minimum of 20 percent may be tested in the first year. For every 3-year period following the initial 2-year period, a random sample of at least 15 percent of installed abatement systems must be tested for each gas and process sub-type or process type combination; you may test 15-percent in the first year of the 3-year period, but you must test at least 5 percent each year until 15 percent are tested. For each 3-year period, you must determine the number of abatement systems to be tested based on the average number of abatement systems in service over the 3-year period. If the required percent of the total number of abatement systems to be tested for each gas and process sub-type or process type combination does not equate to a whole number, the number of systems to be tested must be determined by rounding up to the nearest integer. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section, you may not retest an abatement system for any gas and process sub-type or process type combination, as applicable, until all of the abatement systems for that gas and process sub-type or process type combination have been tested.

At a minimum, include in the description of the analytical method a description of the analytical measurement equipment and procedures, quantitative estimates of the method's accuracy and precision for the analytes of interest at the concentrations of interest, as well as a description of how these accuracies and precisions were estimated, including the validation protocol used. (3) Frequency of measurement and sampling. If you estimate emissions based on monitoring of equipment, conduct monitoring at least annually. Sample at least one-third of equipment annually (except for equipment that is unsafe-to-monitor, difficult-to-monitor, insulated, or in heavy liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with an upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment whose leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device), changing the sample each year such that at the end of three years, all equipment in the process has been monitored. If you estimate emissions based on a sample of the equipment in the process, ensure that the sample is representative of the equipment in the process. If you have multiple processes that have similar types of equipment in similar service, and that produce or transform similar fluorinated GHGs (in terms of chemical composition, molecular weight, and vapor pressure) at similar pressures and concentrations, then you may annually sample all of the equipment in one third of these processes rather than one third of the equipment in each process.

In addition to the information required by § 98.3(g), you must retain the following records: (3) As part of the monitoring plan required under § 98.3(g)(5), record the estimated accuracy of measurement devices and the technical basis for these estimates. (a) For calendar year 2011 monitoring, you may follow the provisions of § 98.3(d)(1) through (d)(2) for best available monitoring methods rather than follow the monitoring requirements of this section. For purposes of this subpart, any reference in § 98.3(d)(1) through (d)(2) to 2010 means 2011, to March 31 means June 30, and to April 1 means July 1. Any reference to the effective date in § 98.3(d)(1) through (d)(2) means February 28, 2011. (d) GHG Monitoring Plans, as described in § 98.3(g)(5), must be completed by April 1, 2011. (d) Monitoring must adhere to one of the methods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(2) of this section.

(4) A strategy for establishing the expected baselines for monitoring CO<E T=""52"">2 surface leakage. (b) Timing. You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA according to the following schedule: (1) A material change was made to monitoring and/or operational parameters that was not anticipated in the original MRV plan. Examples of material changes include but are not limited to: Large changes in the volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 injected; the construction of new injection wells not identified in the MRV plan; failures of the monitoring system including monitoring system sensitivity, performance, location, or baseline; changes to surface land use that affects baseline or operational conditions; observed plume location that differs significantly from the predicted plume area used for developing the MRV plan; a change in the maximum monitoring area or active monitoring area; or a change in monitoring technology that would result in coverage or detection capability different from the MRV plan. (3) If you are notified by EPA of substantive errors in your MRV plan or monitoring report. (e) Revised MRV plan. The requirements of paragraph (c) of this section apply to any submission of a revised MRV plan. You must continue reporting under your currently approved plan while awaiting approval of a revised MRV plan. Active monitoring area is the area that will be monitored over a specific time interval from the first year of the period (n) to the last year in the period (t). The boundary of the active monitoring area is established by superimposing two areas: Maximum monitoring area means the area that must be monitored under this regulation and is defined as equal to or greater than the area expected to contain the free phase CO<E T=""52"">2 plume until the CO<E T=""52"">2 plume has stabilized plus an all-around buffer zone of at least one-half mile.

110,,"The document outlines the detailed requirements for reporting GHG emissions under subpart W, including the calculation, monitoring, and reporting procedures specified in each relevant subpart. It provides specific methods for calculating fluorinated GHG emissions from equipment leaks, such as the use of average emission factor approach, other approaches in conjunction with EPA Method 21, site-specific leak monitoring methods, and the collection of information on equipment types and service. Additionally, it specifies the frequency of measurement and sampling for emissions estimation, as well as the maintenance of equipment leak records and calibration documentation for analytical equipment. The document also includes several tables providing emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for various equipment components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, as well as major crude oil production equipment. These tables offer detailed information on permissible instruments for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W, including valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic device vents for different services and material types. Overall, the document provides a comprehensive overview of the permissible instruments and methods for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W.","(b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term “quantity of GHG supplied” for “emissions.” For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part). (5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the “Definition of Source Category” as specified in an applicable subpart. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the Administrator, as specified in this section. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (i) Electronics Manufacturing (subpart I). (ii) Fluorinated Gas Production (subpart L). (iv) Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (subpart W). (v) Use of Electric Transmission and Distribution Equipment (subpart DD). (vi) Underground Coal Mines (subpart FF). (vii) Industrial Wastewater Treatment (subpart II). (ix) Manufacture of Electric Transmission and Distribution (subpart SS). (x) Industrial Waste Landfills (subpart TT). (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, emissions and other data for individual units, processes, activities, and operations as specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (iii) Any other data specified in the “Data reporting requirements” section of each applicable subpart of this part. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (C) Description of the procedures and methods that are used for quality assurance, maintenance, and repair of all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart of this part. (3) For orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters, the initial quality assurance consists of in-situ calibration of the differential pressure (delta-P), total pressure, and temperature transmitters. (ii) In cases where there are only two transmitters (i.e., differential pressure and either temperature or total pressure) in the immediate vicinity of the flow meter's primary element (e.g., the orifice plate), or when there is only a differential pressure transmitter in close proximity to the primary element, calibration of these existing transmitters to a CE of 2.0 percent or less at each measurement point is still required, in accordance with paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section; alternatively, when two transmitters are calibrated, the results are acceptable if the sum of the CE values for the two transmitters at each calibration level does not exceed 4.0 percent. However, note that installation and calibration of an additional transmitter (or transmitters) at the flow monitor location to measure temperature or total pressure or both is not required in these cases. Instead, you may use assumed values for temperature and/or total pressure, based on measurements of these parameters at a remote location (or locations), provided that the following conditions are met: (6) For units and processes that operate continuously with infrequent outages, it may not be possible to meet the April 1, 2010 deadline for the initial calibration of a flow meter or other measurement device without disrupting normal process operation. In such cases, the owner or operator may postpone the initial calibration until the next scheduled maintenance outage. The best available information from company records may be used in the interim. The subsequent required recalibrations of the flow meters may be similarly postponed. Such postponements shall be documented in the monitoring plan that is required under paragraph (g)(5) of this section. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (iv) Supporting documentation showing that it is not practicable to isolate the process equipment or unit and install the measurement device without a full shutdown or a hot tap, and that there was no opportunity during 2010 to install the device. Include the date of the three most recent shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, the frequency of shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, and the date of the next planned process equipment or unit shutdown. (k) Revised global warming potentials and special provisions for reporting year 2013 and subsequent reporting years. This paragraph (k) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 solely due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart. (1) A facility or supplier that first becomes subject to part 98 due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials, is not required to submit an annual GHG report for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (2) A facility or supplier that was already subject to one or more subparts of part 98 but becomes subject to one or more additional subparts due to a change in the GWP for one or more compounds in Table A–1 of this subpart, is not required to include those subparts to which the facility is subject only due to the change in the GWP in the annual GHG report submitted for the reporting year during which the change in GWPs is published. (4) A change in the GWP for one or more compounds includes the addition to Table A–1 of this subpart of either a chemical-specific or a default GWP that applies to a compound to which no chemical-specific GWP in Table A–1 of this subpart previously applied. (l) Special provision for best available monitoring methods in 2014 and subsequent years. This paragraph (l) applies to owners or operators of facilities or suppliers that first become subject to any subpart of part 98 due to an amendment to Table A–1 of this subpart, Global Warming Potentials. (6) A list of the subparts that the owners and operators anticipate will be included in the annual GHG report. The list of potentially applicable subparts is required only for an initial certificate of representation that is submitted after January 1, 2018 (i.e., for a facility or supplier that previously was not registered under this part). The list of potentially applicable subparts does not need to be revised with revisions to the COR or if the actual applicable subparts change. High-bleed pneumatic devices are automated, continuous bleed flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate in excess of 6 standard cubic feet per hour. Intermittent bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for automatically maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. These are snap-acting or throttling devices that discharge all or a portion of the full volume of the actuator intermittently when control action is necessary, but does not bleed continuously. Low-bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate equal to or less than six standard cubic feet per hour. Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. A safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Valve means any device for halting or regulating the flow of a liquid or gas through a passage, pipeline, inlet, outlet, or orifice; including, but not limited to, gate, globe, plug, ball, butterfly and needle valves. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98.

You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers. (E) The installed CEMS include a gas monitor of any kind or a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, or both and the monitors have been certified, either in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (iv) For the initial calibration of an orifice, nozzle, or venturi meter; in-situ calibration of the transmitters is sufficient. A primary element inspection (PEI) shall be performed at least once every three years. (v) For the continuously-operating units and processes described in § 98.3(i)(6), the required flow meter recalibrations and, if necessary, the PEIs may be postponed until the next scheduled maintenance outage. (i) §§ 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. (3) For ongoing quality assurance, follow the applicable procedures in either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. If appendix F to part 60 of this chapter is selected for on-going quality assurance, perform daily calibration drift assessments for both the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and the flow rate monitor, conduct cylinder gas audits of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor in three of the four quarters of each year (except for non-operating quarters), and perform annual RATAs of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and the CERMS. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more electricity generating units and the facility meets the requirements of § 98.2(a)(1). (b) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C. (iii) Otherwise, you must submit the request within 45 days following promulgation of this subpart or within the first 30 days of each subsequent reporting year.

(c) CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions collected and transferred off site under subpart PP of this part (Suppliers of CO<E T=""52"">2), following the requirements of subpart PP. (iv) Neither the approval process nor the failure to obtain approval for the use of results from previous emissions testing shall abrogate your responsibility to comply with the requirements of this subpart. (1) You may use an alternative method from that specified in this subpart provided that you: (6) Neither the validation and approval process nor the failure to validate or obtain approval of an alternative method shall abrogate your responsibility to comply with the requirements of this subpart. All terms used of this subpart have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A of this part. (d) Calculate fluorinated GHG emissions for equipment leaks (EL). If you comply with paragraph (c) of this section, you must calculate the fluorinated GHG emissions from pieces of equipment associated with processes covered under this subpart and in fluorinated GHG service. If you conduct monitoring of equipment in fluorinated GHG service, monitoring must be conducted for those in light liquid and in gas and vapor service. If you conduct monitoring of equipment in fluorinated GHG service, you may exclude from monitoring each piece of equipment that is difficult-to-monitor, that is unsafe-to-monitor, that is insulated, or that is in heavy liquid service; you may exclude from monitoring each pump with dual mechanical seals, agitator with dual mechanical seals, pump with no external shaft, agitator with no external shaft; you may exclude from monitoring each pressure relief device in gas and vapor service with upstream rupture disk, each sampling connection system with closed-loop or closed-purge systems, and any pieces of equipment where leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device. You must estimate emissions using another approach for those pieces of equipment excluded from monitoring. Equipment that is in fluorinated GHG service for less than 300 hr/yr; equipment that is in vacuum service; pressure relief devices that are in light liquid service; and instrumentation systems are exempted from these requirements. (1) The emissions from equipment leaks must be calculated using any of the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), (d)(1)(iii), or (d)(1)(iv) of this section. (i) Use of Average Emission Factor Approach in EPA Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using the default Average Emission Factor Approach in EPA–453/R–95–017 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (ii) Use of Other Approaches in EPA Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates in conjunction with EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using one of the following methods in EPA–453/R–95–017 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7): The Screening Ranges Approach; the EPA Correlation Approach; or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach. If you determine that EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7 is appropriate for monitoring a fluorinated GHG, and if you calibrate your instrument with a compound different from one or more of the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates to be measured, you must develop response factors for each fluorinated GHG or for each surrogate to be measured using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7. For each fluorinated GHG or surrogate measured, the response factor must be less than 10. The response factor is the ratio of the known concentration of a fluorinated GHG or surrogate to the observed meter reading when measured using an instrument calibrated with the reference compound. (iii) Use of Other Approaches in EPA Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates in conjunction with site-specific leak monitoring methods. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using one of the following methods in EPA–453/R–95–017 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7): The Screening Ranges Approach; the EPA Correlation Approach; or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach. You may develop a site-specific leak monitoring method appropriate for monitoring fluorinated GHGs or surrogates to use along with these three approaches. The site-specific leak monitoring method must meet the requirements in § 98.124(f)(1). (iv) Use of site-specific leak monitoring methods. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using a site-specific leak monitoring method. The site-specific leak monitoring method must meet the requirements in § 98.124(f)(1). (2) You must collect information on the number of each type of equipment; the service of each piece of equipment (gas, light liquid, heavy liquid); the concentration of each fluorinated GHG in the stream; and the time period each piece of equipment was in service. Depending on which approach you follow, you may be required to collect information for equipment on the associated screening data concentrations for greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv and associated screening data concentrations for less than 10,000 ppmv; associated actual screening data concentrations; or associated screening data and leak rate data (i.e., bagging) used to develop a unit-specific correlation. (3) Calculate and sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG in metric tons per year for equipment pieces for each process, E<E T=""52"">ELf, annually. You must include and estimate emissions for types of equipment that are excluded from monitoring, including difficult-to-monitor, unsafe-to-monitor and insulated pieces of equipment, pieces of equipment in heavy liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment where leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device. (f) Emission monitoring for pieces of equipment. If you conduct a site-specific leak detection method or monitoring approach for pieces of equipment, follow paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section and follow paragraph (f)(3) of this section. (1) Site-specific leak monitoring approach. You may develop a site-specific leak monitoring approach. You must validate the leak monitoring method and describe the method and the validation in the GHG Monitoring Plan. To validate the site-specific method, you may, for example, release a known rate of the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates of interest, or you may compare the results of the site-specific method to those of a method that has been validated for the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates of interest. In the description of the leak detection method and its validation, include a detailed description of the method, including the procedures and equipment used and any sampling strategies. Also include the rationale behind the method, including why the method is expected to result in an unbiased estimate of emissions from equipment leaks. If the method is based on methods that are used to detect or quantify leaks or other emissions in other regulations, standards, or guidelines, identify and describe the regulations, standards, or guidelines and why their methods are applicable to emissions of fluorinated GHGs or surrogates from leaks. Account for possible sources of error in the method, e.g., instrument detection limits, measurement biases, and sampling biases. Describe validation efforts, including but not limited to any comparisons against standard leaks or concentrations, any comparisons against other methods, and their results. If you use the Screening Ranges Approach, the EPA Correlation Approach, or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach with a monitoring instrument that does not meet all of the specifications in EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7, then explain how and why the monitoring instrument, as used at your facility, would nevertheless be expected to accurately detect and quantify emissions of fluorinated GHGs or surrogates from process equipment, and describe how you verified its accuracy. For all methods, provide a quantitative estimate of the accuracy and precision of the method. (3) Frequency of measurement and sampling. If you estimate emissions based on monitoring of equipment, conduct monitoring at least annually. Sample at least one-third of equipment annually (except for equipment that is unsafe-to-monitor, difficult-to-monitor, insulated, or in heavy liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with an upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment whose leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device), changing the sample each year such that at the end of three years, all equipment in the process has been monitored. If you estimate emissions based on a sample of the equipment in the process, ensure that the sample is representative of the equipment in the process. If you have multiple processes that have similar types of equipment in similar service, and that produce or transform similar fluorinated GHGs (in terms of chemical composition, molecular weight, and vapor pressure) at similar pressures and concentrations, then you may annually sample all of the equipment in one third of these processes rather than one third of the equipment in each process. (k) Monitoring for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers. Measure the residual fluorinated GHG in containers received by the facility either using scales or using pressure and temperature measurements. You may use pressure and temperature measurements only in cases where no liquid fluorinated GHG is present in the container. Scales must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent or better of the filled weight (gas plus tare) of the containers of fluorinated GHGs that are typically weighed on the scale. For example, for scales that are generally used to weigh cylinders that contain 115 pounds of gas when full and that have a tare weight of 115 pounds, this equates to ±1 percent of 230 pounds, or ±2.3 pounds. Pressure gauges and thermometers used to measure quantities that are monitored under this paragraph must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent of full scale or better. (C) A detailed explanation and supporting documentation of how and when the owner or operator will receive the required data and/or services to comply with the reporting requirements of this subpart in the future. (a) All facilities. In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), you must report the information in paragraphs (a)(2) through (6) of this section according to the schedule in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j) of this section or in § 98.3(c)(4)(vii) and Table A–7 of subpart A of this part. (f) Equipment leak records. If you are subject to § 98.123(d) of this subpart, you must maintain information on the number of each type of equipment; the service of each piece of equipment (gas, light liquid, heavy liquid); the concentration of each fluorinated GHG in the stream; each piece of equipment excluded from monitoring requirement; the time period each piece of equipment was in service, and the emission calculations for each fluorinated GHG for all processes. Depending on which equipment leak monitoring approach you follow, you must maintain information for equipment on the associated screening data concentrations for greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv and associated screening data concentrations for less than 10,000 ppmv; associated actual screening data concentrations; and associated screening data and leak rate data (i.e., bagging) used to develop a unit-specific correlation. If you developed and follow a site-specific leak detection approach, provide the records for monitoring events and the emissions estimation calculations, as appropriate, consistent with the approach for equipment leak emission estimation in your GHG Monitoring Plan. (i) All facilities. Dated records documenting the initial and periodic calibration of all analytical equipment used to determine the concentration of fluorinated GHGs, including but not limited to gas chromatographs, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), gas chromatograph-electron capture detector (GC/ECD), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) devices, and all mass measurement equipment such as weigh scales, flowmeters, and volumetric and density measures used to measure the quantities reported under this subpart, including the industry standards or manufacturer directions used for calibration pursuant to § 98.124(e), (f), (g), (m), and (n). Difficult-to-monitor means the equipment piece may not be monitored without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters (7 feet) above a support surface or it is not accessible in a safe manner when it is in fluorinated GHG service. (2) Equipped with a barrier fluid degassing reservoir that is routed to a process or fuel gas system or connected by a closed-vent system to a control device; or (3) Equipped with a closed-loop system that purges the barrier fluid into a process stream. Equipment (for the purposes of § 98.123(d) and § 98.124(f) only) means each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, and instrumentation system in fluorinated GHG service for a process subject to this subpart; and any destruction devices or closed-vent systems to which processes subject to this subpart are vented. (a) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C. (i) The number of sources of equipment type t with screening values greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv shall be determined using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7, and defining a leak as follows: (2) A leak source at whose surface a concentration of fluorocarbons equal to or greater than 10,000 ppm is measured. (j) The number of sources of equipment type t with screening values less than 10,000 ppmv shall be the difference between the number of leak sources of equipment type t that could emit HFC–23 and the number of sources of equipment type t with screening values greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv as determined under paragraph (i) of this section. (k) The mass of HFC–23 emitted from process vents shall be estimated at least monthly by incorporating the results of the most recent emissions test into Equation O–7 of this subpart. HCFC–22 production facilities that use a destruction device connected to the HCFC–22 production equipment shall conduct emissions tests at process vents at least once every five years or after significant changes to the process. Emissions tests shall be conducted in accordance with EPA Method 18 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–6, under conditions that are typical for the production process at the facility. The sensitivity of the tests shall be sufficient to detect an emission rate that would result in annual emissions of 200 kg of HFC–23 if sustained over one year.

111,,"The document mentioned several calculation methods and specific tables related to emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. However, it does not directly provide a specific equation or method for estimating fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q) using data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm. The provided tables include default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., whole gas leaker emission factors, and total hydrocarbon emission factors for specific equipment and facilities. These tables can be used in conjunction with the calculation methodologies outlined in the document to derive emissions from the data obtained from the state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section: (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources. (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company records. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31, 2010. (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting rule. (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by April 1, 2010. The use of best available methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2010. (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reports. (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (5) A written GHG Monitoring Plan.

(C) Description of the procedures and methods that are used for quality assurance, maintenance, and repair of all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable. (iii) The owner or operator shall revise the GHG Monitoring Plan as needed to reflect changes in production processes, monitoring instrumentation, and quality assurance procedures; or to improve procedures for the maintenance and repair of monitoring systems to reduce the frequency of monitoring equipment downtime. (iv) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall make all information that is collected in conformance with the GHG Monitoring Plan available for review during an audit. Electronic storage of the information in the plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available in hard copy upon request during an audit. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You must also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases where measurement device installation would require a process equipment or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or operator must follow-up this initial notification with the complete extension request containing the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (3) Timing of request. (i) The initial notice of intent must be submitted no later than January 1, 2011, or by the end of the approved use of best available monitoring methods extension in 2010, whichever is earlier. The completed extension request must be submitted to the Administrator no later than February 15, 2011. (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under § 98.3(d). (v) Include a description of the proposed best available monitoring method for estimating GHG emissions during the time prior to installation of the meter. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (3) Starting on January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, facilities or suppliers identified in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section must start monitoring and collecting GHG data in compliance with the applicable subparts of part 98 to which the facility is subject due to the change in the GWP for the annual greenhouse gas report for that reporting year, which is due by March 31 of the following calendar year. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall have one and only one designated representative, who shall be responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same individual shall be the designated representative responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all such other emissions reports under this part. (2) The Administrator will accept a GHG emission report or other submission for a facility or supplier under this part only if the submission is certified, signed, and submitted in accordance with this section. (a) Each GHG report and certificate of representation for a facility or supplier must be submitted electronically in accordance with the requirements of § 98.4 and in a format specified by the Administrator. Acid Rain Program means the program established under title IV of the Clean Air Act, and implemented under parts 72 through 78 of this chapter for the reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions. Continuous emission monitoring system or CEMS means the total equipment required to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings recorded at least once every 15 minutes, a permanent record of gas concentrations, pollutant emission rates, or gas volumetric flow rates from stationary sources.

Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (iv) An oxygen (O<E T=""52"">2) concentration monitor may be used in lieu of a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 concentrations, in accordance with Equation F–14a or F–14b (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, if the effluent gas stream monitored by the CEMS consists solely of combustion products (i.e., no process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions or CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from sorbent are mixed with the combustion products) and if only fuels that are listed in Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter are combusted in the unit. If the O<E T=""52"">2 monitoring option is selected, the F-factors used in Equations F–14a and F–14b shall be determined according to section 3.3.5 or section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable. If Equation F–14b is used, the hourly moisture percentage in the stack gas shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (A) At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if necessary) Method 4 in appendices A–2 and A–3 to part 60 of this chapter to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 3A tests are required, to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration. A Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate (e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded during the test. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate at each set point. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as fu",,3,"The answer provides information about calculation methods and tables related to emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. However, it does not directly answer the question about estimating fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q) using data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm. Therefore, the answer is partially relevant.",1,The answer does not entail whether a specific equation or method for estimating fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q) using data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm exists or not. It only mentions the tables and calculation methodologies provided in the document that can be used to derive emissions from the data obtained from the state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program.,1,0.0,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides information on calculation methods and tables related to emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. However, it does not directly answer the question about estimating fugitive greenhouse gas emissions using data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm. The answer is mostly coherent and provides some relevant information.",925,,
112,,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive emissions from various industrial processes, including electronics manufacturing, adipic acid production, and aluminum production. It also provides details on the measurement and calculation of emissions from stack systems, as well as the determination of destruction efficiency and abatement utilization factor for N2O emissions. Additionally, it includes protocols for equipment leak emission estimates and the determination of volumetric flow rate through specific monitoring systems. The provided tables contain default emission factors for different stages of onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, transmission compression, underground storage, LNG storage, LNG import and export equipment, and natural gas distribution. These tables likely contain the specific emission factors and population counts for different equipment and processes, which are essential for calculating emissions as per the regulations.","(c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<E T=""52"">2 that is captured for transfer off site. (j) Table A–2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (iv) Supporting documentation showing that it is not practicable to isolate the process equipment or unit and install the measurement device without a full shutdown or a hot tap, and that there was no opportunity during 2010 to install the device. Include the date of the three most recent shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, the frequency of shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, and the date of the next planned process equipment or unit shutdown. Carbon dioxide production well facility means one or more carbon dioxide production wells that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, which are under the control of the same entity. Carbon dioxide production wells located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, shall be considered part of the same CO<E T=""52"">2 production well facility if they otherwise meet the definition. (i) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure) after being recovered from oil well (casing-head) gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included. (iv) Petroleum products that are received or produced at a refinery and subsequently injected into a crude supply or reservoir by the same refinery owner or operator. Emergency equipment means any auxiliary fossil fuel-powered equipment, such as a fire pump, that is used only in emergency situations. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Process unit means the equipment assembled and connected by pipes and ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture either a final product or an intermediate used in the onsite production of other products. The process unit also includes the purification of recovered byproducts. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled wells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent produced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well bore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting equipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include high-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture and prop open new fractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the atmosphere. Wellhead means the piping, casing, tubing and connected valves protruding above the earth's surface for an oil and/or natural gas well. The wellhead ends where the flow line connects to a wellhead valve. Wellhead equipment includes all equipment, permanent and portable, located on the improved land area (i.e. well pad) surrounding one or multiple wellheads.

(1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate at each set point. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (A) Use Equation F–11 or F–2 (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates from the CEMS data. If an O<E T=""52"">2 monitor is used, convert the hourly average O<E T=""52"">2 readings to CO<E T=""52"">2 using Equation F–14a or F–14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (as applicable), before applying Equation F–11 or F–2. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (2) The total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions reported for the unit shall include the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion process and the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the sorbent. (6) For certain applications where combined process emissions and combustion emissions are measured, the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentrations in the flue gas may be considerably higher than for combustion emissions alone. In such cases, the span of the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor may, if necessary, be set higher than the specified levels in the applicable regulations. If the CO<E T=""52"">2 span value is set higher than 20 percent CO<E T=""52"">2, the cylinder gas audits of the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor under appendix F to part 60 of this chapter may be performed at 40 to 60 percent and 80 to 100 percent of span, in lieu of the prescribed calibration levels of 5 to 8 percent CO<E T=""52"">2 and 10 to 14 percent CO<E T=""52"">2.

(1) You must conduct the test on the vent stream from the nitric acid oxidation step of the process, referred to as the test point, according to the methods specified in § 98.54(b) through (f). If multiple adipic acid production units exhaust to a common abatement technology and/or emission point, you must sample each process in the ducts before the emissions are combined, sample each process when only one process is operating, or sample the combined emissions when multiple processes are operating and base the site-specific emission factor on the combined production rate of the multiple adipic acid production units. (c) Using the results of the performance test in paragraph (b) of this section, you must calculate an emission factor for each adipic acid unit according to Equation E–1 of this section: (3) Calculate the destruction efficiency by conducting an additional performance test on the vent stream following the N<E T=""52"">2O abatement technology.

(d) You must determine the volumetric flow rate during the performance test in conjunction with the applicable EPA methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendices A–1 through A–4. Conduct three emissions test runs of 1 hour each. All QA/QC procedures specified in the reference test methods and any associated performance specifications apply. For each test, the facility must prepare an emissions factor determination report that must include the items in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section: (b) For missing values related to the performance test, including emission factors, production rate, and N<E T=""52"">2O concentration, you must conduct a new performance test according to the procedures in § 98.54 (a) through (d).

(2) If you manufacture LCDs, you must calculate annual production process emissions of each input gas i for threshold applicability purposes using the default emission factors shown in Table I–1 to this subpart and Equation I–2 of this subpart. (a) You must report emissions of fluorinated GHGs (as defined in § 98.6), N<E T=""52"">2O, and fluorinated heat transfer fluids (as defined in § 98.98). The fluorinated GHGs and fluorinated heat transfer fluids that are emitted from electronics manufacturing production processes include, but are not limited to, those listed in Table I–2 to this subpart. You must individually report, as appropriate: (5) Emissions of fluorinated heat transfer fluids. (a) You must calculate total annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG emitted by electronics manufacturing production processes from each fab (as defined in § 98.98) at your facility, including each input gas and each by-product gas. You must use either default gas utilization rates and by-product formations rates according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(6) of this section, as appropriate, or the stack test method according to paragraph (i) of this section, to calculate emissions of each input gas and each by-product gas. (1) If you manufacture semiconductors, you must adhere to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. You must calculate annual emissions of each input gas and of each by-product gas using Equations I–6 and I–7 of this subpart, respectively. If your fab uses less than 50 kg of a fluorinated GHG in one reporting year, you may calculate emissions as equal to your fab's annual consumption for that specific gas as calculated in Equation I–11 of this subpart, plus any by-product emissions of that gas calculated under paragraph (a) of this section. (i) You must calculate annual fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG used for the plasma etching/wafer cleaning process type using default utilization and by-product formation rates as shown in Table I–3 or I–4 of this subpart, and by using Equations I–8 and I–9 of this subpart. (ii) You must calculate annual fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG used for each of the process sub-types associated with the chamber cleaning process type, including in-situ plasma chamber clean, remote plasma chamber clean, and in-situ thermal chamber clean, using default utilization and by-product formation rates as shown in Table I–3 or I–4 of this subpart, and by using Equations I–8 and I–9 of this subpart. (2) If you manufacture MEMS, LCDs, or PVs, you must calculate annual fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG used for the plasma etching and chamber cleaning process types using default utilization and by-product formation rates as shown in Table I–5, I–6, or I–7 of this subpart, as appropriate, and by using Equations I–8 and I–9 of this subpart. If default values are not available for a particular input gas and process type or sub-type combination in Tables I–5, I–6, or I–7, you must follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. If your fab uses less than 50 kg of a fluorinated GHG in one reporting year, you may calculate emissions as equal to your fab's annual consumption for that specific gas as calculated in Equation I–11 of this subpart, plus any by-product emissions of that gas calculated under this paragraph (a). (b) You must calculate annual fab-level N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from all chemical vapor deposition processes and from the aggregate of all other electronics manufacturing production processes using Equation I–10 of this subpart and the methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. If your fab uses less than 50 kg of N<E T=""52"">2O in one reporting year, you may calculate fab emissions as equal to your fab's annual consumption for N<E T=""52"">2O as calculated in Equation I–11 of this subpart. (e) You must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed, on a fab basis, for each process sub-type or process type j, using Equation I–13 of this subpart. Where a gas supply system serves more than one fab, Equation I–13 is applied to that gas which has been apportioned to each fab served by that system using the apportioning factors determined in accordance with § 98.94(c). If you elect to calculate emissions using the stack test method in paragraph (i) of this section, you must calculate the amount of input gas i consumed on the applicable basis by using an appropriate apportioning factor. For example, when calculating fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG consumed using Equation I–21 of this section, you must substitute the term fij with the appropriate apportioning factor to calculate the total consumption of each fluorinated GHG in tools that are vented to stack systems that are tested. (h) If you use fluorinated heat transfer fluids, you must calculate the annual emissions of fluorinated heat transfer fluids on a fab basis using the mass balance approach described in Equation I–16 of this subpart. (i) Stack Test Method. As an alternative to the default emission factor method in paragraph (a) of this section, you may calculate fab-level fluorinated GHG emissions using fab-specific emission factors developed from stack testing. To use the method in this paragraph, you must first make a preliminary estimate of the fluorinated GHG emissions from each stack system in the fab under paragraph (i)(1) of this section. You must then compare the preliminary estimate for each stack system to the criteria in paragraph (i)(2) of this section to determine whether the stack system meets the criteria for using the stack test method described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section or whether the stack system meets the criteria for using the method described in paragraph (i)(4) of this section to estimate emissions from the stack systems that are not tested. (1) Preliminary estimate of emissions by stack system in the fab. You must calculate a preliminary estimate of the total annual emissions, on a metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e basis, of all fluorinated GHG from each stack system in the fab using default utilization and by-product formation rates as shown in Table I–11, I–12, I–13, I–14, or I–15 of this subpart, as applicable, and by using Equations I–8 and I–9 of this subpart. You must include any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHGs, as defined in § 98.98 of this subpart, in any preliminary estimates. When using Equations I–8 and I–9 of this subpart for the purposes of this paragraph (i)(1), you must also adhere to the procedures in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) to (iv) of this section to calculate preliminary estimates. (iv) If you anticipate an increase or decrease in annual consumption or emissions of any fluorinated GHG, or the number of tools connected to abatement systems greater than 10 percent for the current reporting year compared to the previous reporting year, you must account for the anticipated change in your preliminary estimate. You may account for such a change using a quantifiable metric (e.g., the ratio of the number of tools that are expected to be vented to the stack system in the current year as compared to the previous reporting year, ratio of the expected number of wafer starts in the current reporting year as compared to the previous reporting year), engineering judgment, or other industry standard practice. (i) The sum of annual emissions of fluorinated GHGs from all of the combined stack systems that are not tested in the fab must be less than 10,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. (ii) When all stack systems in the fab are ordered from lowest to highest emitting in metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e of fluorinated GHG per year, each of the stack systems that is not tested must be within the set of the fab's lowest emitting fluorinated GHG stack systems that together emit 15 percent or less of total CO<E T=""52"">2e fluorinated GHG emissions from the fab. (3) Stack system stack test method. For each stack system in the fab for which testing is required, measure the emissions of each fluorinated GHG from the stack system by conducting an emission test. In addition, measure the fab-specific consumption of each fluorinated GHG by the tools that are vented to the stack systems tested. Measure emissions and consumption of each fluorinated GHG as specified in § 98.94(j). Develop fab-specific emission factors and calculate fab-level fluorinated GHG emissions using the procedures specified in paragraph (i)(3)(i) through (viii) of this section. All emissions test data and procedures used in developing emission factors must be documented and recorded according to § 98.97. (i) You must measure, and, if applicable, apportion the fab-specific fluorinated GHG consumption of the tools that are vented to the stack systems that are tested during the emission test as specified in § 98.94(j)(3). Calculate the consumption for each fluorinated GHG for the test period. (A) If a fluorinated GHG is consumed during the sampling period, but emissions are not detected, use one-half of the field detection limit you determined for that fluorinated GHG according to § 98.94(j)(2) for the value of “X<E T=""52"">ism” in Equation I–17. (B) If a fluorinated GHG is consumed during the sampling period and detected intermittently during the sampling period, use the detected concentration for the value of “X<E T=""52"">ism” in Equation I–17 when available and use one-half of the field detection limit you determined for that fluorinated GHG according to § 98.94(j)(2) for the value of “X<E T=""52"">ism” when the fluorinated GHG is not detected. (C) If an expected or possible by-product, as listed in Table I–17 of this subpart, is detected intermittently during the sampling period, use the measured concentration for “X<E T=""52"">ksm” in Equation I–18 when available and use one-half of the field detection limit you determined for that fluorinated GHG according to § 98.94(j)(2) for the value of “X<E T=""52"">ksm” when the fluorinated GHG is not detected. (D) If a fluorinated GHG is not consumed during the sampling period and is an expected by-product gas as listed in Table I–17 of this subpart and is not detected during the sampling period, use one-half of the field detection limit you determined for that fluorinated GHG according to § 98.94(j)(2) for the value of “X<E T=""52"">ksm” in Equation I–18. (E) If a fluorinated GHG is not consumed during the sampling period and is a possible by-product gas as listed in Table I–17 of this subpart, and is not detected during the sampling period, then assume zero emissions for that fluorinated GHG for the tested stack system. (iii) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG input gas consumed (in kg of fluorinated GHG emitted per kg of input gas i consumed) in the tools that vent to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–19 of this subpart. If the emissions of input gas i exceed the consumption of input gas i during the sampling period, then equate “E<E T=""52"">is” to the consumption of input gas i and treat the difference between the emissions and consumption of input gas i as a by-product of the other input gases, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. (iv) You must calculate a fab-specific emission factor for each fluorinated GHG formed as a by-product (in kg of fluorinated GHG per kg of total fluorinated GHG consumed) in the tools vented to stack systems that are tested, as applicable, using Equation I–20 of this subpart. When calculating the by-product emission factor for an input gas for which emissions exceeded its consumption, exclude the consumption of that input gas from the term “∑(Activity<E T=""52"">if).” (viii) When using the stack testing option described in paragraph (i) of this section, you must calculate the weighted-average fraction of each fluorinated input gas i and each fluorinated byproduct gas k destroyed or removed in abatement systems for each fab f, as applicable, by using Equation I–24A (for input gases) and Equation I–24B (for by-product gases) of this subpart. (4) Method to calculate emissions from stack systems that are not tested. You must calculate annual fab-level emissions of each fluorinated GHG input gas and byproduct gas for those fluorinated GHG listed in paragraphs (i)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section using default utilization and by-product formation rates as shown in Table I–11, I–12, I–13, I–14, or I–15 of this subpart, as applicable, and by using Equations I–8, I–9, and I–13 of this subpart. When using Equations I–8, I–9, and I–13 to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph, you must use, in place of the term C<E T=""52"">ij in each equation, the total consumption of each fluorinated GHG meeting the criteria in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section or that is used in tools vented to the stack systems that meet the criteria in paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section. You must use, in place of the term a<E T=""52"">ij, the fraction of fluorinated GHG meeting the criteria in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section used in tools with abatement systems or that is used in tools with abatement systems that are vented to the stack systems that meet the criteria in paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section. You also must use the results of Equations I–24A and I–24B of this subpart in place of the terms d<E T=""52"">ij in Equation I–8 and d<E T=""52"">jk in Equation I–9, respectively, and use the results of Equation I–23 of this subpart in place of the results of Equation I–15 of this subpart for the term UT<E T=""52"">ij. (i) Calculate emissions from consumption of each intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG as defined in § 98.98 of this subpart using the default utilization and by-product formation rates and equations specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. If a fluorinated GHG was not being used during the stack testing and does not meet the definition of intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG in § 98.98, then you must test the stack systems associated with the use of that fluorinated GHG at a time when that gas is in use at a magnitude that would allow you to determine an emission factor for that gas according to the procedures specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. (ii) Calculate emissions from consumption of each fluorinated GHG used in tools vented to stack systems that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (i)(2)(iii) of this section, and were not tested according to the procedures in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Calculate emissions using the default utilization and by-product formation rates and equations specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section.

It includes tables such as W-1A, W-1B, W-1C, W-1D, and W-1E, which provide emission factors, component counts, and designations for different regions. While the document covers a wide range of emission-related data, it does not specifically address the 'total throughput off the acid gas removal unit' as mentioned in the question. Therefore, the document does not provide direct information regarding whether the 'total throughput off the acid gas removal unit' refers to the volume of gas exiting the AGR unit or the volume of gas vented to the atmosphere.","(iii) Engineering calculations. (iii) Engineering calculations. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks.

The method(s) used shall be documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section.

(A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (ii) The procedures in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. (iii) Determine the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the unit by multiplying the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by the annual average biogenic decimal fraction obtained from § 98.34(d) or § 98.34(e), as applicable.

(4) For the purposes of this part, the stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor RATAs required by appendix B to part 75 of this chapter and the annual RATAs of the CERMS required by appendix F to part 60 of this chapter need only be done at one operating level, representing normal load or normal process operating conditions, both for initial certification and for ongoing quality assurance.

(1) Oil and Gas Field Code Master List 2008, DOE/EIA0370(08), January 2009, IBR approved for § 98.238. (ii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in therms, use Equation C–1a. (iii) If natural gas consumption is obtained from billing records and fuel usage is expressed in mmBtu, use Equation C–1b. (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (iii) If the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration is measured on a dry basis, a correction for the stack gas moisture content is required. You shall either continuously monitor the stack gas moisture content using a method described in § 75.11(b)(2) of this chapter or use an appropriate default moisture percentage. For coal, wood, and natural gas combustion, you may use the default moisture values specified in § 75.11(b)(1) of this chapter. Alternatively, for any type of fuel, you may determine an appropriate site-specific default moisture value (or values), using measurements made with EPA Method 4—Determination Of Moisture Content In Stack Gases, in appendix A–3 to part 60 of this chapter. Moisture data from the relative accuracy test audit (RATA) of a CEMS may be used for this purpose. If this option is selected, the site-specific moisture default value(s) must represent the fuel(s) or fuel blends that are combusted in the unit during normal, stable operation, and must account for any distinct difference(s) in the stack gas moisture content associated with different process operating conditions. For each site-specific default moisture percentage, at least nine Method 4 runs are required, except where the option to use moisture data from a RATA is selected, and the applicable regulation allows a single moisture determination to represent two or more RATA runs. In that case, you may base the site-specific moisture percentage on the number of moisture runs allowed by the RATA regulation. Calculate each site-specific default moisture value by taking the arithmetic average of the Method 4 runs. Each site-specific moisture default value shall be updated whenever the owner or operator believes the current value is non-representative, due to changes in unit or process operation, but in any event no less frequently than annually. Use the updated moisture value in the subsequent CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculations. For each unit operating hour, a moisture correction must be applied to Equation C–6 of this section as follows: (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (C) The CO<E T=""52"">2 and stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors meet the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(E) and (b)(4)(ii)(F) of this section. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation. (i) Use Equation C–8a to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms. (ii) Use Equation C–8b to calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu. (iii) Calculate the annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion using Equation C–13 of this section. If two or more types of fossil fuel are combusted during the year, perform a separate calculation with Equation C–13 of this section for each fuel and sum the results. (v) Calculate the biogenic percentage of the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions,expressed as a decimal fraction, using Equation C–14 of this section: (ii) Determine the relative proportions of biogenic and non-biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions in the flue gas on a quarterly basis using the method specified in § 98.34(d) (for units that combust MSW as the primary fuel or as the only fuel with a biogenic component) or in § 98.34(e) (for other units, including units that combust tires). (iii) Determine the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the unit by multiplying the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by the annual average biogenic decimal fraction obtained from § 98.34(d) or § 98.34(e), as applicable. (B) Multiply the result from paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section by the appropriate default factor to determine the annual biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions, in metric tons. For MSW, use a default factor of 0.60 and for tires, use a default factor of 0.20. (3) Special considerations for blending of fuels. In situations where different types of fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (for example, different ranks of coal or different grades of fuel oil) are in the same state of matter (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas), and are blended prior to combustion, use the following procedures to determine the appropriate CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor and HHV for the blend. (i) If the fuels to be blended are received separately, and if the quantity (mass or volume) of each fuel is measured before the fuels are mixed and combusted, then, for each component of the blend, calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately. Substitute into Equation C–2a of this subpart the total measured mass or volume of the component fuel (from company records), together with the appropriate default CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor from Table C–1, and the annual average HHV, calculated according to § 98.33(a)(2)(ii). In this case, the fact that the fuels are blended prior to combustion is of no consequence. (ii) If the fuel is received as a blend (i.e., already mixed) or if the components are mixed on site without precisely measuring the mass or volume of each one individually, a reasonable estimate of the relative proportions of the components of the blend must be made, using the best available information (e.g., the approximate annual average mass or volume percentage of each fuel, based on the typical or expected range of values). Determine the appropriate CO<E T=""52"">2 emission factor and HHV for use in Equation C–2a of this subpart, as follows: (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (F) For mixtures (blends) of solid fuels, weekly sampling is required to obtain composite samples, which are analyzed monthly. For blends of liquid fuels, and for gas mixtures consisting only of natural gas and biogas, sampling and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. For gas mixtures that contain gases other than natural gas (including biogas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-line equipment is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. (v) To calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from combustion of a blend of fuels in the same state of matter (solid, liquid, or gas), you may either: (i) §§ 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. (6) For certain applications where combined process emissions and combustion emissions are measured, the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentrations in the flue gas may be considerably higher than for combustion emissions alone. In such cases, the span of the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor may, if necessary, be set higher than the specified levels in the applicable regulations. If the CO<E T=""52"">2 span value is set higher than 20 percent CO<E T=""52"">2, the cylinder gas audits of the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor under appendix F to part 60 of this chapter may be performed at 40 to 60 percent and 80 to 100 percent of span, in lieu of the prescribed calibration levels of 5 to 8 percent CO<E T=""52"">2 and 10 to 14 percent CO<E T=""52"">2. (d) Except as otherwise provided in § 98.33(b)(1)(vi) and (vii), when municipal solid waste (MSW) is either the primary fuel combusted in a unit or the only fuel with a biogenic component combusted in the unit, determine the biogenic portion of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using ASTM D6866–16 Standard Test Methods for Determining the Biobased Content of Solid, Liquid, and Gaseous Samples Using Radiocarbon Analysis) and ASTM D7459–08 Standard Practice for Collection of Integrated Samples for the Speciation of Biomass (Biogenic) and Fossil-Derived Carbon Dioxide Emitted from Stationary Emissions Sources (both incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). Perform the ASTM D7459–08 sampling and the ASTM D6866–16 analysis at least once in every calendar quarter in which MSW is combusted in the unit. Collect each gas sample during normal unit operating conditions for at least 24 total (not necessarily consecutive) hours, or longer if the facility deems it necessary to obtain a representative sample. Notwithstanding this requirement, if the types of fuels combusted and their relative proportions are consistent throughout the year, the minimum required sampling time may be reduced to 8 hours if at least two 8-hour samples and one 24-hour sample are collected under normal operating conditions, and arithmetic average of the biogenic fraction of the flue gas from the 8-hour samples (expressed as a decimal) is within ±5 percent of the biogenic fraction from the 24-hour test. There must be no overlapping of the 8-hour and 24-hour test periods. Document the results of the demonstration in the unit's monitoring plan. If the types of fuels and their relative proportions are not consistent throughout the year, an optional sampling approach that facilities may wish to consider to obtain a more representative sample is to collect an integrated sample by extracting a small amount of flue gas (e.g., 1 to 5 cc) in each unit operating hour during the quarter. Separate the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions into the biogenic and non-biogenic fractions using the average proportion of biogenic emissions of all samples analyzed during the reporting year. Express the results as a decimal fraction (e.g., 0.30, if 30 percent of the CO<E T=""52"">2 is biogenic). When MSW is the primary fuel for multiple units at the facility, and the units are fed from a common fuel source, testing at only one of the units is sufficient. (4) Sorbent usage, when § 98.33(d) applies. (6) Biogenic fuel consumption and high heating value, as applicable, under §§ 98.33(e)(5) and (e)(6). (7) Fuel usage for CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions calculations under § 98.33(c)(4)(ii). (8) Mass of biomass combusted, for premixed fuels that contain biomass and fossil fuels under § 98.33(e)(1)(iii). (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (vii) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions and annual CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each fuel type for the units served by the common pipe, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e. (ii) Use the alternative methods for units with continuous monitoring systems provided in § 98.33(a)(5). (C) The carbon content and, if applicable, gas molecular weight values used in the emission calculations (including both valid and substitute data values). For each calendar month of the reporting year in which carbon content and, if applicable, molecular weight determination is required, report a value of each parameter. If multiple values of a parameter are obtained in a given month, report the arithmetic average value for the month. Express carbon content as a decimal fraction for solid fuels, kg C per gallon for liquid fuels, and kg C per kg of fuel for gaseous fuels. Express the gas molecular weights in units of kg per kg-mole. (C) For CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, and (if applicable) stack gas moisture content, the percentage of source operating hours in which a substitute data value of each parameter was used in the emissions calculations.

(B) The annual volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels, i.e., V<E T=""52"">ff, in scf. If more than one type of fossil fuel was combusted, report the combustion volume of CO<E T=""52"">2 for each fuel separately as well as the total.

(A) The results of each quarterly sample analysis, expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., if the biogenic fraction of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from MSW combustion is 30 percent, report 0.30). (xi) When ASTM methods D7459–08 and D6866–16 (both incorporated by reference, see § 98.7) are used in accordance with § 98.34(e) to determine the biogenic portion of the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from a unit that co-fires biogenic fuels (or partly-biogenic fuels, including tires if you are electing to report biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from tire combustion) and non-biogenic fuels, you shall report the results of each quarterly sample analysis, expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., if the biogenic fraction of the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions is 30 percent, report 0.30).

(34) High heat value of the each liquid fossil fuel (Btu/gallons) (Equation C–13). (35) High heat value of the each gaseous fossil fuel (Btu/scf) (Equation C–13). Follow the applicable missing data substitution procedures in 40 CFR part 75 for CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content. (1) Annual paste consumption if using the method in § 98.63(g). (8) Weight fraction of C<E T=""52"">2F6/CF<E T=""52"">4 per potline per month (kg C<E T=""52"">2F<E T=""52"">6/kg CF<E T=""52"">4) (Equation F–4 of § 98.63). (1) Gaseous feedstock. You must calculate, from each ammonia manufacturing unit, the CO<E T=""52"">2 process emissions from gaseous feedstock according to Equation G–1 of this section: (1) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (13) Annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions (metric tons) from the steam reforming of a hydrocarbon or the gasification of solid and liquid raw material at the ammonia manufacturing process unit used to produce urea and the method used to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 consumed in urea production. (1) Volume of each gaseous feedstock used in month (scf of feedstock) (in Equation G–1 of § 98.73). (2) Carbon content of each gaseous feedstock, for month (kg C per kg of feedstock) (in Equation G–1). (5) Carbon content of each liquid feedstock, for month (kg C per gallon of feedstock) (Equation G–2). (16) Organic carbon content of each raw material per kiln, as determined in § 98.84(c). Default value is 0.002 weight fraction (Equation H–5). (17) Organic carbon content of combined raw kiln feed per kiln, as determined in § 98.84(c). Default value is 0.002 weight fraction (Equation H–5). (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption (including the fraction of gas consumed by process tools connected to abatement systems as in Equations I–8, I–9, I–10, I–19, I–20, I–21, and I–22 of this subpart), to use in the equations of this subpart for each input gas i, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate, using a fab-specific engineering model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under § 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts, or direct measurement of input gas consumption as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. To verify your model, you must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. (3) As an alternative to developing apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption using a fab-specific engineering model, you may develop apportioning factors through the use of direct measurement using gas flow meters and weigh scales to measure process sub-type, process type, stack system, or fab-specific input gas consumption. You may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a fab-specific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5). (B) The relative standard deviation for all single fluorinated GHGs that individually accounted for 5 percent or more of CO<E T=""52"">2e emissions were less than 20 percent. (2) The start and end dates selected under § 98.94(c)(2)(i). (5) In addition to the inventory specified in § 98.96(p), the information in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section: Gas utilization means the fraction of input N<E T=""52"">2O or fluorinated GHG converted to other substances during the etching, deposition, and/or wafer and chamber cleaning processes. Gas utilization is expressed as a rate or factor for specific electronics manufacturing process sub-types or process types. (1) Measuring contents of each container. If you weigh or otherwise measure the contents of each container before venting the residual fluorinated GHGs, use Equation L–32 of this section to calculate annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG from venting of residual fluorinated GHG from containers. Convert pressures to masses as directed in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. (i) Sample size. For each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type that you vent, select a representative sample of containers that reflects the full range of quantities of residual gas returned in that container size and type. This sample must reflect the full range of the industries and a broad range of the customers that use and return the fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type. The minimum sample size for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type must be 30, unless this is greater than the number of containers returned within that combination annually, in which case the contents of every container returned must be measured. (k) Monitoring for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers. Measure the residual fluorinated GHG in containers received by the facility either using scales or using pressure and temperature measurements. You may use pressure and temperature measurements only in cases where no liquid fluorinated GHG is present in the container. Scales must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent or better of the filled weight (gas plus tare) of the containers of fluorinated GHGs that are typically weighed on the scale. For example, for scales that are generally used to weigh cylinders that contain 115 pounds of gas when full and that have a tare weight of 115 pounds, this equates to ±1 percent of 230 pounds, or ±2.3 pounds. Pressure gauges and thermometers used to measure quantities that are monitored under this paragraph must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent of full scale or better. (1) The mass of the residual fluorinated GHG vented from containers annually (metric tons). Vapor pressures may be determined by standard reference texts or ASTM D–2879, (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (c) As an alternative to data provided by the raw material supplier, a value of 1.0 can be used for the mass fraction (MF<E T=""52"">i) of carbonate-based mineral i in Equation N–1 of this section. (b) Unless you use the default value of 1.0, you must measure carbonate-based mineral mass fractions at least annually to verify the mass fraction data provided by the supplier of the raw material; such measurements shall be based on sampling and chemical analysis using consensus standards that specify X-ray fluorescence. For measurements made in years prior to the emissions reporting year 2014, you may also use ASTM D3682–01 (Reapproved 2006) Standard Test Method for Major and Minor Elements in Combustion Residues from Coal Utilization Processes or ASTM D6349–09 Standard Test Method for Determination of Major and Minor Elements in Coal, Coke, and Solid Residues from Combustion of Coal and Coke by Inductively Coupled Plasma—Atomic Emission Spectrometry (both incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (d) Unless you use the default value of 1.0, you must determine on an annual basis the calcination fraction for each carbonate consumed based on sampling and chemical analysis using an industry consensus standard. If performed, this chemical analysis must be conducted using an x-ray fluorescence test or other enhanced testing method published by an industry consensus standards organization (e.g., ASTM, ASME, API, etc.). In addition to the information required by § 98.3(g), you must retain the records listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. (3) Data on carbonate-based mineral mass fractions provided by the raw material supplier for all raw materials consumed annually and included in calculating process emissions in Equation N–1 of this subpart, if applicable. (5) The decimal fraction of calcination achieved for each carbonate-based raw material, if a value other than 1.0 is used to calculate process mass emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2. (1) Annual average decimal mass fraction of carbonate-based mineral in each carbonate-based raw material for each continuous glass melting furnace (specify the default value, if used, or the value determined according to § 98.144) (percentage, expressed as a decimal) (Equation N–1 of § 98.143). (3) The total mass of HFC–23 emitted from destruction devices shall be estimated by using Equation O–8 of this section: (d) If the HFC–23 concentration measured pursuant to § 98.154(l) is greater than that measured during the performance test that is the basis for the destruction efficiency (DE), the facility shall report the method used to calculate the revised destruction efficiency, specifying whether § 98.154(l)(1) or (2) has been used for the calculation. (b) Fuel and feedstock material balance approach. Calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions as the sum of the annual emissions associated with each fuel and feedstock used for hydrogen production by following paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The carbon content and molecular weight shall be obtained from the analyses conducted in accordance with § 98.164(b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4), as applicable, or from the missing data procedures in § 98.165. If the analyses are performed annually, then the annual value shall be used as the monthly average. If the analyses are performed more frequently than monthly, use the arithmetic average of values obtained during the month as the monthly average. (1) Gaseous fuel and feedstock. You must calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from each gaseous fuel and feedstock according to Equation P–1 of this section: (2) Determine the carbon content and the molecular weight annually of standard gaseous hydrocarbon fuels and feedstocks having consistent composition (e.g., natural gas). For other gaseous fuels and feedstocks (e.g., biogas, refinery gas, or process gas), sample and analyze no less frequently than weekly to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel and feedstock. (i) ASTM D1945–03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7).

115,,"The document mentioned that acid gas removal units are defined as process units that separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas using liquid or solid absorbents or membrane separators. It also states that the emissions from acid gas removal units, including those used only to sweeten a liquid stream, are specifically mentioned and are required to be calculated using specific calculation methods. Therefore, based on the provided information, acid gas removal units used only to sweeten a liquid stream do meet the definition of acid gas removal units as per the environmental regulations.","Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and, if necessary, units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment, as necessary, and transport to a stationary combustion unit. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the various combustion units at the refinery or petrochemical plant. (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (viii) If CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions that are generated from acid gas scrubbing with sorbent injection are not captured using CEMS, report: (3) If you use default destruction and removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), you must certify and document that the abatement systems at your facility for which you use default destruction or removal efficiency values are specifically designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as applicable. If you elect to calculate fluorinated GHG emissions using the stack test method under § 98.93(i), you must also certify that you have included and accounted for all abatement systems designed for fluorinated GHG abatement and any respective downtime in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(i)(3). (iv) If a measured destruction or removal efficiency is below the manufacturer-claimed fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O destruction or removal efficiency for any abatement system specifically designed for fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O abatement and the abatement system is installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the site maintenance plan for abatement systems that is developed and maintained in your records as specified in § 98.97(d)(9), the measured destruction or removal efficiency must be included in the calculation of the destruction or removal efficiency value for that gas and process sub-type or process type. (p) Inventory and description of all abatement systems through which fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O flow at your facility and for which you are claiming destruction or removal efficiency, including: (iii) If you use default destruction or removal efficiency values in your emissions calculations under § 98.93(a), (b), and/or (i), certification that the abatement systems for which emissions are being reported were specifically designed for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O abatement, as required under § 98.94(f)(3), and certification that the site maintenance plan includes manufacturer's recommendations and specifications for installation, operation, and maintenance for all applicable abatement systems. (ii) The average destruction or removal efficiency of the abatement systems operating during the reporting year for each process type and gas combination. Abatement system means a device or equipment that is designed to destroy or remove fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O in exhaust streams from one or more electronics manufacturing production processes, or for which the destruction or removal efficiency for a fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O has been properly measured according to the procedures under § 98.94(f)(4), even if that abatement system is not designed to destroy or remove fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O. The device or equipment is only an abatement system for the individual fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that it is designed to destroy or remove or for the individual fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O for which destruction or removal efficiencies were properly measured according to the procedures under § 98.94(f)(4). Destruction or removal efficiency (DRE) means the efficiency of an abatement system to destroy or remove fluorinated GHGs, N<E T=""52"">2O, or both. The destruction or removal efficiency is equal to one minus the ratio of the mass of all relevant GHGs exiting the abatement system to the mass of GHG entering the abatement system. When GHGs are formed in an abatement system, destruction or removal efficiency is expressed as one minus the ratio of amounts of exiting GHGs to the amounts entering the system in units of CO<E T=""52"">2-equivalents (CO<E T=""52"">2e). Redundant abatement systems means a system that is specifically designed, installed and operated for the purpose of destroying fluorinated GHGs and N<E T=""52"">2O gases, or for which the destruction or removal efficiency for a fluorinated GHG or N<E T=""52"">2O has been properly measured according to the procedures under § 98.94(f)(4), and that is used as a backup to the main fluorinated GHGs and N<E T=""52"">2O abatement system during those times when the main system is not functioning or operating in accordance with design and operating specifications. (1) You must conduct the performance test at the absorber tail gas vent, referred to as the test point, for each nitric acid train according to § 98.224(b) through (f). If multiple nitric acid trains exhaust to a common abatement technology and/or emission point, you must sample each process in the ducts before the emissions are combined, sample each process when only one process is operating, or sample the combined emissions when multiple processes are operating and base the site-specific emission factor on the combined production rate of the multiple nitric acid trains. (7) Destruction efficiency of N<E T=""52"">2O abatement technology that is used on each nitric acid train (decimal fraction of N<E T=""52"">2O removed from vent stream) (Equation V–3a of § 98.223). (9) Destruction efficiency of each N<E T=""52"">2O abatement technology that is used on each nitric acid train (decimal fraction of N<E T=""52"">2O removed from vent stream) (Equation V–3c of § 98.223).

(3) Calculation Method 3. If a CEMS or a vent meter is not installed, you may use the inlet or outlet gas flow rate of the acid gas removal unit to calculate emissions for CO<E T=""52"">2 using Equations W–4A or W–4B of this section. If inlet gas flow rate is known, use Equation W–4A. If outlet gas flow rate is known, use Equation W–4B. (iii) Acid gas content of outlet natural gas. (6) For Calculation Method 2, if a continuous gas analyzer is not available on the vent stack, either install a continuous gas analyzer or take quarterly gas samples from the vent gas stream for each quarter that the AGR unit is operating to determine Vol<E T=""52"">CO2 in Equation W–3 of this section, according to the methods set forth in § 98.234(b). (ii) If a continuous gas analyzer is not available or installed, quarterly gas samples may be taken from the outlet gas stream for each quarter that the AGR unit is operating to determine Vol<E T=""52"">O in Equation W–4A or W–4B of this section, according to the methods set forth in § 98.234(b).

",,3,"The answer partially addresses the context and question by providing information about acid gas removal units and their definition, but it does not directly answer the question or provide information about sweetening a liquid stream.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context. The context defines acid gas removal units as process units that separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas using liquid or solid absorbents or membrane separators. It also states that emissions from acid gas removal units, including those used only to sweeten a liquid stream, are specifically mentioned and are required to be calculated using specific calculation methods. Therefore, it logically follows that acid gas removal units used only to sweeten a liquid stream do meet the definition of acid gas removal units as per the environmental regulations.",1,0.0,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the definition of acid gas removal units and how they are regulated under environmental regulations.,618,,
116,,"{'explanation': 'The given input provides relevant information about the emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. These emission factors are crucial for calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different source categories. However, the input does not directly address the specific scenario of recovering and transferring all emissions outside the facility and whether emissions need to be reduced to zero in that case.', 'recommendation': 'It would be beneficial to provide specific sections or clauses from the document that directly address the scenario of recovering and transferring all emissions outside the facility. This would enable a more targeted analysis and extraction of relevant information related to the question.'}","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers.

Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that all applicable processes and operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section cease to operate, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the reporting years following the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all applicable processes and operations no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. If one or more processes or operations subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section at a facility or supplier cease to operate, but not all applicable processes or operations cease to operate, then the owner or operator is exempt from reporting for any such processes or operations in the reporting years following the reporting year in which cessation of the process or operation occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which the process or operation has ceased for an entire reporting year. Cessation of operations in the context of underground coal mines includes, but is not limited to, abandoning and sealing the facility. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to the municipal solid waste landfills source category (subpart HH of this subpart), or the industrial waste landfills source category (subpart TT of this part). The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume operation. (6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes. (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows.

Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. Gas-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of gaseous fuels, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil or other liquid fuels. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Liberated means released from coal and surrounding rock strata during the mining process. This includes both methane emitted from the ventilation system and methane drained from degasification systems. Oil-fired unit means a stationary combustion unit that derives more than 50 percent of its annual heat input from the combustion of fuel oil, and the remainder of its annual heat input from the combustion of natural gas or other gaseous fuels. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an emission source for any purpose. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel.

(3) Irrigation pumps at agricultural operations. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (2) Any fuel listed in Table C–1 of this subpart is also combusted in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (ii) When the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration is measured on a wet basis, Equation C–6 of this section is used to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 emission rates: (v) Each hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from Equation C–6 or C–7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during which effluent gases flow through the common stack. (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (B) Calculate a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate (in metric tons/hr) from the stack test data, using a version of Equation C–6 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, modified as follows. In the Equation C–6 nomenclature, replace the words “Hourly average” in the definitions of “C<E T=""52"">CO2” and “Q” with the words “3-run average”. Substitute the arithmetic average values of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate from the emission testing into modified Equation C–6. If CO<E T=""52"">2 is measured on a dry basis, a moisture correction of the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate is required. Use Equation C–7 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section to make this correction; replace the word “Hourly” with the words “3-run average” in the equation nomenclature. (C) The results of each annual stack test shall be used in the GHG emissions calculations for the year of the test. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate at each set point. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (G) Finally, add the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum as the total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the unit. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Use the hourly heat input data from appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, together with Equation G–4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates, in units of tons/hr; (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons; and (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows: (A) Calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons, using Equation LM–11 in § 75.19(c)(4)(iii) of this chapter. (B) Sum the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions values over the entire reporting year to obtain the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (A) Use Equation F–11 or F–2 (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates from the CEMS data. If an O<E T=""52"">2 monitor is used, convert the hourly average O<E T=""52"">2 readings to CO<E T=""52"">2 using Equation F–14a or F–14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (as applicable), before applying Equation F–11 or F–2. (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mas",,,,1,"The given context and answer do not relate to the provided information about greenhouse gas reporting requirements for facilities.

AGA means the American Gas Association Air injected flare means a flare in which air is blown into the base of a flare stack to induce complete combustion of gas. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Carbon dioxide stream means carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source (e.g. a power plant or other industrial facility) or extracted from a carbon dioxide production well plus incidental associated substances either derived from the source materials and the capture process or extracted with the carbon dioxide. Centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing vent emissions means emissions that occur when the high-pressure oil barriers for centrifugal compressors are depressurized to release absorbed natural gas or CO<E T=""52"">2. High-pressure oil is used as a barrier against escaping gas in centrifugal compressor shafts. Very little gas escapes through the oil barrier, but under high pressure, considerably more gas is absorbed by the oil. The seal oil is purged of the absorbed gas (using heaters, flash tanks, and degassing techniques) and recirculated. The separated gas is commonly vented to the atmosphere. Degasification system means the entirety of the equipment that is used to drain gas from underground coal mines. This includes all degasification wells and gob gas vent holes at the underground coal mine. Degasification systems include gob and premine surface drainage wells, gob and premine in-mine drainage wells, and in-mine gob and premine cross-measure borehole wells. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. (2) With respect to fluorinated GHGs, the expiration of a fluorinated GHG to the destruction efficiency actually achieved. Such destruction does not result in a commercially useful end product. Facility means any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. Operators of military installations may classify such installations as more than a single facility based on distinct and independent functional groupings within contiguous military properties. (1) Off-loading used or excess fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide of U.S. origin from a ship during servicing. Liberated means released from coal and surrounding rock strata during the mining process. This includes both methane emitted from the ventilation system and methane drained from degasification systems. (4) The equipment is moved from one location to another in an attempt to circumvent the portable residence time requirements of this definition. Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Sendout means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production. Sweet gas is natural gas with low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<E T=""52"">2S) and/or carbon dioxide (CO<E T=""52"">2) that does not require (or has already had) acid gas treatment to meet pipeline corrosion-prevention specifications for transmission and distribution. Transshipment means the continuous shipment of nitrous oxide or a fluorinated GHG from a foreign state of origin through the United States or its territories to a second foreign state of final destination, as long as the shipment does not enter into United States jurisdiction. A transshipment, as it moves through the United States or its territories, cannot be re-packaged, sorted or otherwise changed in condition. Vapor recovery system means any equipment located at the source of potential gas emissions to the atmosphere or to a flare, that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices, and that is used for routing the gas back into the process as a product and/or fuel. You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98. (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using Equation C–1, C–1a, or C–1b of this section (as applicable). (2) Tier 2 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each type of fuel by using either Equation C2a or C2c of this section, as appropriate. (3) Tier 3 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each fuel by using either Equation C3, C4, or C5 of this section, as appropriate. (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). (vi) The hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions are then summed over each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, determine and report the biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (A) At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if necessary) Method 4 in appendices A–2 and A–3 to part 60 of this chapter to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 3A tests are required, to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration. A Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate (e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded during the test. (B) Calculate a CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate (in metric tons/hr) from the stack test data, using a version of Equation C–6 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, modified as follows. In the Equation C–6 nomenclature, replace the words “Hourly average” in the definitions of “C<E T=""52"">CO2” and “Q” with the words “3-run average”. Substitute the arithmetic average values of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate from the emission testing into modified Equation C–6. If CO<E T=""52"">2 is measured on a dry basis, a moisture correction of the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate is required. Use Equation C–7 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section to make this correction; replace the word “Hourly” with the words “3-run average” in the equation nomenclature. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate at each set point. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (A) Use the hourly heat input data from appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, together with Equation G–4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to determine the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates, in units of tons/hr; (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons; and (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (A) Calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, in units of short tons, using Equation LM–11 in § 75.19(c)(4)(iii) of this chapter. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (A) Use Equation F–11 or F–2 (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates from the CEMS data. If an O<E T=""52"">2 monitor is used, convert the hourly average O<E T=""52"">2 readings to CO<E T=""52"">2 using Equation F–14a or F–14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (as applicable), before applying Equation F–11 or F–2. (B) Use Equations F–12 and F–13 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons. (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions value by 1.1023 to convert it to metric tons. (b) Use of the four tiers. Use of the four tiers of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions calculation methodologies described in paragraph (a) of this section is subject to the following conditions, requirements, and restrictions: (A) The use of Tier 1 or 2 is permitted, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii), (b)(1)(v), (b)(1)(viii), and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. (B) The fuel provides 10% or more of the annual heat input to the unit or, if § 98.36(c)(3) applies, to the group of units served by a common supply pipe. (ii) Shall be used if the unit meets all six of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(F) of this section: (B) The unit meets the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(B) through (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section. (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met. (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of the monitors needed to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions have been installed and certified by that date. (1) Use Equation C–8 of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<E T=""52"">2, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C–8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C–8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C–8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation. (2) Use Equation C–9a of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 2 Equation C–2a of this section to estimate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions. Use the same values for fuel consumption and HHV that you use for the Tier 2 calculation. (3) Use Equation C–9b of this section to estimate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for any fuels for which you use Equation C–2c of this section to calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions. Use the same values for steam generation and the ratio “B” that you use for Equation C–2c. (i) If only one type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart is combusted during the reporting year, substitute the cumulative annual heat input from combustion of the fuel into Equation C–10 of this section to calculate the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 or N<E T=""52"">2O emissions. For units in the Acid Rain Program and units that report heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, obtain the cumulative annual heat input directly from the electronic data reports required under § 75.64 of this chapter. For Tier 4 units, use the best available information, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate the cumulative annual heat input (HI)<E T=""52"">A. (ii) If more than one type of fuel listed in Table C–2 of this subpart is combusted during the reporting year, use Equation C–10 of this section separately for each type of fuel, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. Determine the appropriate values of (HI)<E T=""52"">A as follows: (D) Sum the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions across all component fuels to obtain the annual CH<E T=""52"">4 emissions for the blend. Similarly sum the annual N<E T=""52"">2O emissions across all component fuels to obtain the annual N<E T=""52"">2O emissions for the blend. Report these annual emissions totals. (2) The total annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions reported for the unit shall include the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion process and the CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the sorbent. (1) You may use Equation C–1 of this subpart to calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions from the combustion of the biomass fuels listed in Table C–1 of this subpart (except MSW and tires), in a unit of any size, including units equipped with a CO<E T=""52"">2 CEMS, except when the use of Tier 2 is required as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. Determine the quantity of biomass combusted using one of the following procedures in this paragraph (e)(1), as appropriate, and document the selected procedures in the Monitoring",,,,,,1,0.0,,,,,4362,,
118,,"The document specifies that flow meters used for AGR vents must be calibrated according to specific procedures and methods, and the calibration error at each measurement point must not exceed 5.0 percent of the reference value. It also provides detailed requirements for the initial calibration, subsequent recalibrations, and exemptions for certain types of flow meters. Additionally, it mentions the use of various industry standards and consensus-based methods for calibration. Therefore, the use of a meter to measure flow rates for AGR vents is required, and it must be calibrated according to the specified procedures and accuracy requirements.","(i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data from each measurement device shall be documented in the written monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. (i) All flow meters and other measurement devices that are subject to the provisions of this paragraph (i) must be calibrated according to one of the following: You may use the manufacturer's recommended procedures; an appropriate industry consensus standard method; or a method specified in a relevant subpart of this part. The calibration method(s) used shall be documented in the monitoring plan required under paragraph (g) of this section. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (iii) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, subsequent recalibrations of the flow meters and other measurement devices subject to the requirements of this paragraph (i) shall be performed at one of the following frequencies: (2) Perform all flow meter calibration at measurement points that are representative of the normal operating range of the meter. Except for the orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, calculate the calibration error at each measurement point using Equation A–2 of this section. The terms “R” and “A” in Equation A–2 must be expressed in consistent units of measure (e.g., gallons/minute, ft3/min). The calibration error at each measurement point shall not exceed 5.0 percent of the reference value. (3) For orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters, the initial quality assurance consists of in-situ calibration of the differential pressure (delta-P), total pressure, and temperature transmitters. (ii) In cases where there are only two transmitters (i.e., differential pressure and either temperature or total pressure) in the immediate vicinity of the flow meter's primary element (e.g., the orifice plate), or when there is only a differential pressure transmitter in close proximity to the primary element, calibration of these existing transmitters to a CE of 2.0 percent or less at each measurement point is still required, in accordance with paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section; alternatively, when two transmitters are calibrated, the results are acceptable if the sum of the CE values for the two transmitters at each calibration level does not exceed 4.0 percent. However, note that installation and calibration of an additional transmitter (or transmitters) at the flow monitor location to measure temperature or total pressure or both is not required in these cases. Instead, you may use assumed values for temperature and/or total pressure, based on measurements of these parameters at a remote location (or locations), provided that the following conditions are met: (A) You must demonstrate that measurements at the remote location(s) can, when appropriate correction factors are applied, reliably and accurately represent the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter under all expected ambient conditions. (B) You must make all temperature and/or total pressure measurements in the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section with calibrated gauges, sensors, transmitters, or other appropriate measurement devices. At a minimum, calibrate each of these devices to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, according to one of the following. You may calibrate using a manufacturer's specification or an industry consensus standard. (D) You must use the mathematical correlation(s) derived from the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to convert the remote temperature or the total pressure readings, or both, to the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter, or both, on a daily basis. You shall then use the actual temperature and total pressure values to correct the measured flow rates to standard conditions. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (5) For a flow meter that has been previously calibrated in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section, an additional calibration is not required by the date specified in paragraph (i)(1) of this section if, as of that date, the previous calibration is still active (i.e., the device is not yet due for recalibration because the time interval between successive calibrations has not elapsed). In this case, the deadline for the successive calibrations of the flow meter shall be set according to one of the following. You may use either the manufacturer's recommended calibration schedule or you may use the industry consensus calibration schedule. (6) For units and processes that operate continuously with infrequent outages, it may not be possible to meet the April 1, 2010 deadline for the initial calibration of a flow meter or other measurement device without disrupting normal process operation. In such cases, the owner or operator may postpone the initial calibration until the next scheduled maintenance outage. The best available information from company records may be used in the interim. The subsequent required recalibrations of the flow meters may be similarly postponed. Such postponements shall be documented in the monitoring plan that is required under paragraph (g)(5) of this section. (7) If the results of an initial calibration or a recalibration fail to meet the required accuracy specification, data from the flow meter shall be considered invalid, beginning with the hour of the failed calibration and continuing until a successful calibration is completed. You shall follow the missing data provisions provided in the relevant missing data sections during the period of data invalidation. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. Dehydrator vent emissions means natural gas and CO<E T=""52"">2 released from a natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation pumps. Flowmeter means a device that measures the mass or volumetric rate of flow of a gas, liquid, or solid moving through an open or closed conduit (e.g. flowmeters include, but are not limited to, rotameters, turbine meters, coriolis meters, orifice meters, ultra-sonic flowmeters, and vortex flowmeters). Low-bleed pneumatic devices mean automated flow control devices powered by pressurized natural gas and used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure and temperature. Part of the gas power stream that is regulated by the process condition flows to a valve actuator controller where it vents continuously (bleeds) to the atmosphere at a rate equal to or less than six standard cubic feet per hour. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks.

Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA), 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). The method(s) used shall be documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5). (i) This methodology requires a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates in metric tons per hour. (A) At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if necessary) Method 4 in appendices A–2 and A–3 to part 60 of this chapter to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 3A tests are required, to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration. A Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate (e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded during the test. (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), you may use the calculated CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section. (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate at each set point. (F) Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for the diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust system by the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the stack test. Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering judgment, apply the most representative CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section to determine the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions for each hour in which flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours. (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses flow rate and CO<E T=""52"">2 (or O<E T=""52"">2) CEMS to report heat input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions as follows: (A) Use Equation F–11 or F–2 (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rates from the CEMS data. If an O<E T=""52"">2 monitor is used, convert the hourly average O<E T=""52"">2 readings to CO<E T=""52"">2 using Equation F–14a or F–14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (as applicable), before applying Equation F–11 or F–2. (E) The installed CEMS include a gas monitor of any kind or a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, or both and the monitors have been certified, either in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (F) The installed gas or stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors are required, either by an applicable Federal or State regulation or by the unit's operating permit, to undergo periodic quality assurance testing in accordance with either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (C) The CO<E T=""52"">2 and stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors meet the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(E) and (b)(4)(ii)(F) of this section. (1) You must calibrate each oil and gas flow meter according to § 98.3(i) and the provisions of this paragraph (b)(1). (A) You may use the calibration procedures specified by the flow meter manufacturer. (B) You may use an appropriate flow meter calibration method published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such a method exists. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA, 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). (ii) In addition to the initial calibration required by § 98.3(i), recalibrate each fuel flow meter (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) according to one of the following. You may recalibrate annually, at the minimum frequency specified by the manufacturer, or at the interval specified by industry standard practice. (iii) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the initial and ongoing calibration requirements of this paragraph and from the Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping requirements of §§ 98.3(g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7), provided that the fuel supplier and the unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are only used for unit startup are also exempted from the initial and ongoing calibration requirements of this paragraph. (v) For the continuously-operating units and processes described in § 98.3(i)(6), the required flow meter recalibrations and, if necessary, the PEIs may be postponed until the next scheduled maintenance outage. (vi) If a mixture of liquid or gaseous fuels is transported by a common pipe, you may either separately meter each of the fuels prior to mixing, using flow meters calibrated according to § 98.3(i), or consider the fuel mixture to be the “fuel type” and meter the mixed fuel, using a flow meter calibrated according to § 98.3(i). (c) For the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, the CO<E T=""52"">2, flow rate, and (if applicable) moisture monitors must be certified prior to the applicable deadline specified in § 98.33(b)(5). (3) For ongoing quality assurance, follow the applicable procedures in either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. If appendix F to part 60 of this chapter is selected for on-going quality assurance, perform daily calibration drift assessments for both the CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor) and the flow rate monitor, conduct cylinder gas audits of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor in three of the four quarters of each year (except for non-operating quarters), and perform annual RATAs of the CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor and the CERMS. (4) For the purposes of this part, the stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor RATAs required by appendix B to part 75 of this chapter and the annual RATAs of the CERMS required by appendix F to part 60 of this chapter need only be done at one operating level, representing normal load or normal process operating conditions, both for initial certification and for ongoing quality assurance. (5) If, for any source operating hour, quality assured data are not obtained with a CO<E T=""52"">2 monitor (or surrogate O<E T=""52"">2 monitor), flow rate monitor, or (if applicable) moisture monitor, use appropriate substitute data values in accordance with the missing data provisions of § 98.35. (i) The total quantity of the fuel combusted during the report year in the units sharing the fuel supply is measured, either at the “gate” to the facility or at a point inside the facility, using a fuel flow meter, billing meter, or tank drop measurements (as applicable); (A) For liquid and gaseous fuel combustion, the dates and results of the initial calibrations and periodic recalibrations of the required fuel flow meters. (D) The methods used to calibrate the fuel flow meters). (3) You must measure the adipic acid production rate during the test and calculate the production rate for the test period in tons per hour. (i) You must determine the amount of process N<E T=""52"">2O emissions that is sold or transferred off site (if applicable). You can determine the amount using existing process flow meters and N<E T=""52"">2O analyzers. (1) Direct measurement (such as using flow meters or weigh scales). (d) You must determine the volumetric flow rate during the performance test in conjunction with the applicable EPA methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendices A–1 through A–4. Conduct three emissions test runs of 1 hour each. All QA/QC procedures specified in the reference test methods and any associated performance specifications apply. For each test, the facility must prepare an emissions factor determination report that must include the items in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section: (5) Volumetric flow rate per test run during performance test (dscf/hr). (a) You must continuously measure the quantity of gaseous or liquid feedstock consumed using a flow meter. The quantity of solid feedstock consumed can be obtained from company records and aggregated on a monthly basis. (d) Calibrate all oil and gas flow meters that are used to measure liquid and gaseous feedstock volumes and flow rates (except for gas billing meters) according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for the Tier 3 methodology in § 98.34(b)(1). Perform oil tank drop measurements (if used to quantify feedstock volumes) according to § 98.34(b)(2). (i) You must measure, and, if applicable, apportion the fab-specific fluorinated GHG consumption of the tools that are vented to the stack systems that are tested during the emission test as specified in § 98.94(j)(3). Calculate the consumption for each fluorinated GHG for the test period. (2) The trigger points for change out you use to calculate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your containers. If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas. (3) As an alternative to developing apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N<E T=""52"">2O consumption using a fab-specific engineering model, you may develop apportioning factors through the use of direct measurement using gas flow meters and weigh scales to measure process sub-type, process type, stack system, or fab-specific input gas consumption. You may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a fab-specific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5). (i) All flow meters, weigh scales, pressure gauges, and thermometers used to measure quantities that are monitored under this section or used in calculations under § 98.93 must meet the calibration and accuracy requirements specified in § 98.3(i). (i) Measure fluorinated GHG consumption using gas flow meters, scales, or pressure measurements. Measure the mass or pressure, as applicable, at the beginning and end of the sampling period and when containers are changed out. If you elect to measure gas consumption using pressure (i.e., because the gas is stored in a location above its critical temperature) you must estimate consumption as specified in paragraphs (j)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. (ii) For each fluorinated GHG gas for which consumption is too low to be accurately measured during the sampling period using gas flow meters, scales, or pressure measurements as specified in paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section, you must follow at least one of the procedures listed in paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section to obtain a consumption measurement. (i) You must determine the flowrate of gas (or volume of gas), partial pressures of condensables, temperature (T), and fluorinated GHG molecular weight (MW<E T=""52"">Fluorinated GHG) at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver. (A) The destruction efficiencies of the device that have been demonstrated for the fluorinated GHGs in the vent stream for periods when the process vent is vented to the destruction device. (iii) You must measure the process activity, such as the process feed rate, process production rate, or other process activity rate, as applicable, during the emission test and calculate the rate for the test period, in kg (or another appropriate metric) per hour. (iv) For continuous processes, you must calculate the hourly emission rate of each fluorinated GHG using Equation L–19 of this section and determine the hourly emission rate of each fluorinated GHG per process vent (and per operating scenario, as applicable) for the test run. (viii) Adjusted process-vent-specific emission factors for other operating scenarios. For process vents from processes with multiple operating scenarios, use Equation L–23 of this section to develop an adjusted process-vent-specific emission factor for each operating scenario from which the vent is estimated to emit less than 10,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e annually or whose emission calculation factor differs by less than 15 percent from the emission calculation factor of the operating scenario that is expected to have the largest emissions (or of another operating scenario for which emission testing is performed). (2) You must collect information on the number of each type of equipment; the service of each piece of equipment (gas, light liquid, heavy liquid); the concentration of each fluorinated GHG in the stream; and the time period each piece of equipment was in service. Depending on which approach you follow, you may be required to collect information for equipment on the associated screening data concentrations for greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv and associated screening data concentrations for less than 10,000 ppmv; associated actual screening data concentrations; or associated screening data and leak rate data (i.e., bagging) used to develop a unit-specific correlation. (ii) Measurement of residual gas. The residual weight or pressure you use for paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your cylinders/containers according to § 98.124(k). If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using a form of the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation L–33 of this section, with an appropriately selected Z value. (2) Number of runs. For continuous processes, sample the process vent for a minimum of three runs of 1 hour each. If the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the emission factor calculated based on the first three runs is greater than or equal to 0.15 for the emission factor, continue to sample the process vent for an additional three runs of 1 hour each. If more than one fluorinated GHG is measured, the RSD must be expressed in terms of total CO<E T=""52"">2e. (3) Process activity measurements. Determine the mass rate of process feed, process production, or other process activity as applicable during the test using flow meters, weigh scales, or other measurement devices or instruments with an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent of full scale or better. These devices may be the same plant instruments or procedures that are used for accounting purposes (such as weigh hoppers, belt weigh feeders, combination of volume measurements and bulk density, etc.) if these devices or procedures meet the requirement. For monitoring ongoing process activity, use flow meters, weigh scales, or othe",,,,5,"The answer accurately summarizes the requirements for flow meter calibration for AGR vents as specified in the document, including the need for specific calibration procedures and accuracy requirements, as well as exemptions for certain types of flow meters. The answer also correctly notes the use of industry standards and consensus-based methods for calibration.",1,0.0,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,4,"The document provides detailed requirements for the calibration of flow meters used for AGR vents, including specific procedures and accuracy requirements. It also mentions the use of industry standards and consensus-based methods for calibration. While the document does not explicitly mention coherence, the information provided is well-organized and logically presented, indicating a mostly coherent answer.",650,,
119,,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emissions from the data. Equation W-3 is used to calculate and report emissions for specific fuel types. The equation CO2 = Fuel * EF, where CO2 is the annual CO2 mass emissions for the specific fuel type in metric tons, Fuel is the mass or volume of the fuel combusted per year, and EF is the fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor in kg CO2/mmBtu. The equation indicates that emissions are calculated based on the amount of fuel combusted and the emission factor for that specific fuel type. As for the use of a flow meter to calculate annual emission CO2, it is not directly mentioned in the provided information. However, the document does provide details on the use of flow meters for emission calculations and the calibration requirements for measurement devices, which implies that flow meters may be used for emission calculations under certain conditions.","(a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied. (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A–4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source categories listed in Table A–3 and Table A–4 of this subpart. (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only. (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources.

(c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each GHG to metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year using Equation A–1 of this section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility. (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold for importers and exporters of coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and, that are exported during the reporting year.

Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and for importers and exporters of CO<E T=""52"">2, the owner or operator shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2e imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. (1) Calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is imported and the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG that is exported during the year.

(3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for all exported GHGs. (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting and retain such records for three years following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year. The owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under § 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such records for three years prior to notification of discontinuation of reporting following the year that reporting was discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons CO<E T=""52"">2e per year or more. (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified in each relevant subpart of this part. (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. (4) For facilities, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12) of this section, report annual emissions of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6), and each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) as follows. (i) Annual emissions (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2) aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. For electronics manufacturing (as defined in § 98.90), starting in reporting year 2012 the CO<E T=""52"">2e calculation must include each fluorinated heat transfer fluid (as defined in § 98.98) whether or not it is also a fluorinated GHG. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 aggregated for all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section. (5) For suppliers, report annual quantities of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and each fluorinated GHG (as defined in § 98.6) that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products supplied, imported, and exported during the year. Calculate and report quantities at the following levels: (6) A written explanation, as required under § 98.3(e), if you change emission calculation methodologies during the reporting period. (12) For the 2010 reporting year only, facilities that have “part 75 units” (i.e. units that are subject to subpart D of this part or units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions in accordance with § 98.33(a)(5)) must report annual GHG emissions either in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section or in full accordance with paragraphs (c)(12)(i) through (c)(12)(iii) of this section. If the latter reporting option is chosen, you must report: (i) Annual emissions aggregated for all GHG from all applicable source categories, expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2e calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these annual emissions, but exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from any non-part 75 units and other source categories. (ii) Annual emissions of biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2, expressed in metric tons (excluding biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units), aggregated for all applicable source categories. (iii) Annual emissions from each applicable source category, expressed in metric tons of each applicable GHG listed in paragraphs (c)(12)(iii)(A) through (c)(12)(iii)(E) of this section. (B) CO<E T=""52"">2. You must include biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from part 75 units in these totals and exclude biogenic CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from other non-part 75 units and other source categories. (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010. (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this paragraph: (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets the conditions of § 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must be submitted by September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The abbreviated facility report must include the following information: (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel combustion units calculated according to any method specified in § 98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, N<E T=""52"">2O, and CO<E T=""52"">2e. (v) For each stationary fuel combustion source that meets the criteria specified in § 98.36(f), report any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. A stationary fuel combustion source that does not meet the criteria specified in § 98.36(f) must either report the data specified in this paragraph (d)(3)(v) in the annual report or use verification software according to § 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting the data specified in this paragraph. (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in methodology was required. (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for which GHG emission were calculated. (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type. These data include but are not limited to the following information in this paragraph (g)(2): (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used. For data required by § 98.5(b) to be entered into verification software specified in § 98.5(b), maintain the entered data in the format generated by the verification software according to § 98.5(b). (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific emissions factors. (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the GHG emission calculations. (3) The annual GHG reports. (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) for collection of the emissions data. (B) Explanation of the processes and methods used to collect the necessary data for the GHG calculations. (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part. (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as defined in § 98.6) or the use of “best available information” is specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data from each measurement device shall be documented in the written monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. (i) All flow meters and other measurement devices that are subject to the provisions of this paragraph (i) must be calibrated according to one of the following: You may use the manufacturer's recommended procedures; an appropriate industry consensus standard method; or a method specified in a relevant subpart of this part. The calibration method(s) used shall be documented in the monitoring plan required under paragraph (g) of this section. (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date. (2) Perform all flow meter calibration at measurement points that are representative of the normal operating range of the meter. Except for the orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, calculate the calibration error at each measurement point using Equation A–2 of this section. The terms “R” and “A” in Equation A–2 must be expressed in consistent units of measure (e.g., gallons/minute, ft3/min). The calibration error at each measurement point shall not exceed 5.0 percent of the reference value. (ii) In cases where there are only two transmitters (i.e., differential pressure and either temperature or total pressure) in the immediate vicinity of the flow meter's primary element (e.g., the orifice plate), or when there is only a differential pressure transmitter in close proximity to the primary element, calibration of these existing transmitters to a CE of 2.0 percent or less at each measurement point is still required, in accordance with paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section; alternatively, when two transmitters are calibrated, the results are acceptable if the sum of the CE values for the two transmitters at each calibration level does not exceed 4.0 percent. However, note that installation and calibration of an additional transmitter (or transmitters) at the flow monitor location to measure temperature or total pressure or both is not required in these cases. Instead, you may use assumed values for temperature and/or total pressure, based on measurements of these parameters at a remote location (or locations), provided that the following conditions are met: (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You must also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this information in a format suitable for auditing and inspection. (D) You must use the mathematical correlation(s) derived from the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to convert the remote temperature or the total pressure readings, or both, to the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter, or both, on a daily basis. You shall then use the actual temperature and total pressure values to correct the measured flow rates to standard conditions. (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted from the calibration requirements of this section. (6) For units and processes that operate continuously with infrequent outages, it may not be possible to meet the April 1, 2010 deadline for the initial calibration of a flow meter or other measurement device without disrupting normal process operation. In such cases, the owner or operator may postpone the initial calibration until the next scheduled maintenance outage. The best available information from company records may be used in the interim. The subsequent required recalibrations of the flow meters may be similarly postponed. Such postponements shall be documented in the monitoring plan that is required under paragraph (g)(5) of this section. (j) Measurement device installation—(1) General. If an owner or operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the extension period. (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013. (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be installed is appropriate. An owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the Administrator. (1) Best available monitoring methods. From January 1 to March 31 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, owners or operators subject to this paragraph (l) may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter (e.g., fuel use, feedstock rates) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the “Calculating GHG Emissions” sections of each relevant subpart, but may use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published. Starting no later than April 1 of the year after the year during which the change in GWPs is published, the owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods: Calculation methodology means a methodology prescribed under the section “Calculating GHG Emissions” in any subpart of part 98. Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO<E T=""52"">2e means the number of metric tons of CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions with the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another greenhouse gas, and is calculated using Equation A–1 of this subpart. Carbon dioxide stream means carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source (e.g. a power plant or other industrial facility) or extracted from a carbon dioxide production well plus incidental associated substances either derived from the source materials and the capture process or extracted with the carbon dioxide. Continuous emission monitoring system or CEMS means the total equipment required to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings recorded at least once every 15 minutes, a permanent record of gas concentrations, pollutant emission rates, or gas volumetric flow rates from stationary sources. Flowmeter means a device that measures the mass or volumetric rate of flow of a gas, liquid, or solid moving through an open or closed conduit (e.g. flowmeters include, but are not limited to, rotameters, turbine meters, coriolis meters, orifice meters, ultra-sonic flowmeters, and vortex flowmeters). Process emissions means the emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement production, ammonia production) involving chemical or physical transformations other than fuel combustion. For example, the calcination of carbonates in a kiln during cement production or the oxidation of methane in an ammonia process results in the release of process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions to the atmosphere. Emissions from fuel combustion to provide process heat are not part of process emissions, whether the combustion is internal or external to the process equipment. Reporting year means the calendar year during which the GHG data are required to be collected for purposes of the annual GHG report. For example, reporting year 2014 is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the annual report for reporting year 2014 is submitted to EPA on March 31, 2015.

Any violation of any requirement of this part shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act, including section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414). A violation includes but is not limited to failure to report GHG emissions, failure to collect data needed to calculate GHG emissions, failure to continuously monitor and test as required, failure to retain records needed to verify the amount of GHG emissions, and failure to calculate GHG emissions following the methodologies specified in this part. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in § 261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required unless either of the following conditions apply: (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions. You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). You must report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O mass emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit, except as otherwise indicated in this subpart. You must calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section, and calculate CH<E T=""52"">4 and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section. (a) CO<E T=""54"">2 emissions from fuel combustion. Calculate CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions by using one of the four calculation methodologies in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, subject to the applicable conditions, requirements, and restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Alternatively, for units that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may use CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions calculation methods from part 75 of this chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and report CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from the combustion of biomass separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and in § 98.36(d). (1) Tier 1 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual CO<E T=""52",,1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the context and question.,5,"The answer is not directly mentioned in the provided information, but the document provides details on the use of calculation methodologies and emission factors to derive emissions from fuel combustion. The answer correctly explains the use of Equation W-3 to calculate emissions for specific fuel types and mentions the calibration requirements for measurement devices, which implies the use of flow meters for emission calculations under certain conditions. Overall, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",1,0.0,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,4,"The document provides detailed calculation methodologies for deriving emissions from various sources, including fuel combustion. While the use of flow meters for emission calculations is not directly mentioned, the document does provide information on the calibration requirements for measurement devices, which implies that flow meters may be used for emission calculations under certain conditions. Overall, the document is mostly coherent and provides clear information on the reporting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions.",950,,
120,,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emission from the data. It provides equations for calculating mass in metric tons per year of CO2 resulting from the combustion or oxidation of petroleum products and natural gas liquids. The equations also cover the calculation of GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products. Additionally, it outlines methods for calculating heat value, compressibility factor, and relative density of gaseous fuels, as well as the use of fuel flow meters for liquid or gaseous fuels. The document also provides guidance on measuring the quantity of gaseous or liquid feedstock consumed using a flow meter, estimating fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, and measuring residual fluorinated GHGs in containers. The equations and explanations cover a wide range of environmental considerations and calculations related to emissions from different processes and sources. However, the specific reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume and whether it refers to gas volume or physical container volume is not explicitly addressed in the provided text.","(e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2e per year threshold for importers and exporters of petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<E T=""52"">2 that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the combined volume of petroleum products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting year and that are exported during the reporting year. Compare the imported quantities and the exported quantities separately to the 25,000 metric ton CO<E T=""52"">2 per year threshold. Calculate the quantities using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part. Blowdown mean the act of emptying or depressuring a vessel. This may also refer to the discarded material such as blowdown water from a boiler or cooling tower. Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system testing. Bulk, with respect to industrial GHG suppliers and CO2 suppliers, means the transfer of a product inside containers, including but not limited to tanks, cylinders, drums, and pressure vessels. Bulk natural gas liquid or NGL refers to mixtures of hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas as liquids through the process of absorption, condensation, adsorption, or other methods. Generally, such liquids consist of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes plus. Bulk NGL is sold to fractionators or to refineries and petrochemical plants where the fractionation takes place. Density means the mass contained in a given unit volume (mass/volume). Flowmeter means a device that measures the mass or volumetric rate of flow of a gas, liquid, or solid moving through an open or closed conduit (e.g. flowmeters include, but are not limited to, rotameters, turbine meters, coriolis meters, orifice meters, ultra-sonic flowmeters, and vortex flowmeters). Fuel means solid, liquid or gaseous combustible material. Gas conditions mean the actual temperature, volume, and pressure of a gas sample. Gas to oil ratio (GOR) means the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. Heel means the amount of gas that remains in a shipping container after it is discharged or off-loaded (that is no more than ten percent of the volume of the container). High heat value or HHV means the high or gross heat content of the fuel with the heat of vaporization included. The water is assumed to be in a liquid state. Process vent means means a gas stream that: Is discharged through a conveyance to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through a control device; originates from a unit operation, including but not limited to reactors (including reformers, crackers, and furnaces, and separation equipment for products and recovered byproducts); and contains or has the potential to contain GHG that is generated in the process. Process vent does not include safety device discharges, equipment leaks, gas streams routed to a fuel gas system or to a flare, discharges from storage tanks. Sales oil means produced crude oil or condensate measured at the production lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) meter or custody transfer tank gauge. Storage tank means a vessel (excluding sumps) that is designed to contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water and that is constructed entirely of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) that provide structural support. Working capacity, for the purposes of subpart TT of this part, means the maximum volume or mass of waste that is actually placed in the landfill from an individual or representative type of container (such as a tank, truck, or roll-off bin) used to convey wastes to the landfill, taking into account that the container may not be able to be 100 percent filled and/or 100 percent emptied for each load.

(iv) Fuel flow meters that measure mass flow rates may be used for liquid or gaseous fuels, provided that the fuel density is used to convert the readings to volumetric flow rates. The density shall be measured at the same frequency as the carbon content. You must measure the density using one of the following appropriate methods. You may use a method published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such a method exists, or you may use industry standard practice. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428–B2959, (800) 262–1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293–8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA), 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824–7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016–5990, (800) 843–2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005–4070, (202) 682–8000, http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356–0060, http://www.api.org). The method(s) used shall be documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5).

(viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions, CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions shall be determined as follows: (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to develop a correlation between CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate and the parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the average CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration obtained in the annual stack test is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emission rate at each set point. (E) The installed CEMS include a gas monitor of any kind or a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, or both and the monitors have been certified, either in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (F) The installed gas or stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors are required, either by an applicable Federal or State regulation or by the unit's operating permit, to undergo periodic quality assurance testing in accordance with either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration monitor. (C) The CO<E T=""52"">2 and stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors meet the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(E) and (b)(4)(ii)(F) of this section. (iv) May apply to common stack or duct configurations where: (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met. (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section. (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this part to use Tier 4, the CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at each individual unit, or the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<E T=""52"">2 mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct. (2) Oil tank drop measurements (if used to determine liquid fuel use volume) shall be performed according to any an appropriate method published by a consensus-based standards organization (e.g., the American Petroleum Institute). (G) The value of the molar volume constant (MVC) used in Equation C–5 (if applicable). (2) Volume of each liquid fuel combusted (gallons/year) (Equation C–1).

(21) Annual volume of each gaseous fuel combusted (scf/year) (Equation C–5 of § 98.33). (3) Calculate the destruction efficiency by conducting an additional performance test on the vent stream following the N<E T=""52"">2O abatement technology. (g) If process CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions from anode consumption during electrolysis or anode baking of prebake cells are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall not be used to calculate those process emissions. The owner or operation shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). (a) You must continuously measure the quantity of gaseous or liquid feedstock consumed using a flow meter. The quantity of solid feedstock consumed can be obtained from company records and aggregated on a monthly basis. (1) Volume of each gaseous feedstock used in month (scf of feedstock) (in Equation G–1 of § 98.73). (4) Volume of each liquid feedstock used in month (gallons of feedstock) (Equation G–2 of § 98.73). (b) For purposes of Equation I–12 of this subpart, you must estimate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each gas used, according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. This paragraph (b) does not apply to fluorinated GHGs or N<E T=""52"">2O that your fab uses in quantities of less than 50 kg in one reporting year and for which you calculate emissions as equal to consumption under § 98.93(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b), or for any intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG for which you calculate emissions according to § 98.93(i)(4)(i). (1) Base your fab-wide gas-specific heel factors on the trigger point for change out of a container for each container size and type for each gas used. Fab-wide gas-specific heel factors must be expressed as the ratio of the trigger point for change out, in terms of mass, to the initial mass in the container, as determined by paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. (2) The trigger points for change out you use to calculate fab-wide gas-specific heel factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your containers. If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas. (4) If a container is changed in an exceptional circumstance, as specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, you must weigh that container or measure the pressure of that container with a pressure gauge, in place of using a heel factor to determine the residual weight of gas. When using mass-based trigger points for change out, you must determine if an exceptional circumstance has occurred based on the net weight of gas in the container, excluding the tare weight of the container. (i) For containers with a maximum storage capacity of less than 9.08 kg (20 lbs) of gas, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 50 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type. (ii) For all other containers, an exceptional circumstance is a change out point that differs by more than 20 percent from the trigger point for change out used to calculate your fab-wide gas-specific heel factor for that gas and container type. (4) As part of normal operations for each fab, the inventory of gas stored in containers at the beginning of the reporting year must be the same as the inventory of gas stored in containers at the end of the previous reporting year. You must maintain records documenting the year end and year beginning inventories under § 98.97(a). (4) Ensure that the total quantity of gas i in containers in service at the end of a reporting year is accounted for as if the in-service containers were full for Equation I–11 of this subpart. Ensure also that the same quantity is accounted for in the inventory of input gas i stored in containers at the beginning of the subsequent reporting year. (i) You must conduct an emission test during which the fab is operating at a representative operating level, as defined in § 98.98, and with the abatement systems connected to the stack system being tested operating with at least 90 percent uptime, averaged over all abatement systems, during the 8-hour (or longer) period for each stack system, or at no less than 90 percent of the abatement system uptime rate measured over the previous reporting year, averaged over all abatement systems. (iv) Although all applicable stack systems are not required to be tested simultaneously, you must certify that no significant changes in stack flow configuration occur between tests conducted for any particular fab in a reporting year. You must certify that no more than 10 percent of the total number of fluorinated GHG emitting process tools are connected or disconnected from a stack system during testing. You must also certify that no process tools that were in operation at the start of the test period have been moved to a different stack system during the test period (i.e., during or in between testing of individual stack systems) and that no point-of-use abatement systems have been permanently removed from service during the test period. You must document any changes in stack flow configuration in the emissions test data and report required to be kept as records under § 98.97(i)(4). (i) Measure fluorinated GHG consumption using gas flow meters, scales, or pressure measurements. Measure the mass or pressure, as applicable, at the beginning and end of the sampling period and when containers are changed out. If you elect to measure gas consumption using pressure (i.e., because the gas is stored in a location above its critical temperature) you must estimate consumption as specified in paragraphs (j)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. (A) For each fluorinated GHG, you must either measure the temperature of the fluorinated GHG container(s) when the sampling periods begin and end and when containers are changed out, or measure the temperature of the fluorinated GHG container(s) every hour for the duration of the sampling period. Temperature measurements of the immediate vicinity of the containers (e.g., in the same room, near the containers) shall be considered temperature measurements of the containers. (B) Convert the sampling period-beginning, sampling period-ending, and container change-out pressures to masses using Equation I–25 of this subpart, with the appropriate Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas (e.g., the Z value yielded by the Redlich, Kwong, Soave equation of state with appropriate values for that gas). Apply the temperatures measured at or nearest to the beginning and end of the sampling period and to the time(s) when containers are changed out, as applicable. For each gas, the consumption during the sampling period is the difference between the masses of the containers of that gas at the beginning and at the end of the sampling period, summed across containers, including containers that are changed out. (A) Draw the gas from a single gas container if it is normally supplied from multiple containers connected by a shared manifold. (9) The number of tools vented to each stack system in the fab. Actual gas consumption means the quantity of gas used during wafer/substrate processing over some period based on a measured change in gas container weight or gas container pressure or on a measured volume of gas. Heel means the amount of gas that remains in a gas container after it is discharged or off-loaded; heel may vary by container type. Stack system means one or more stacks that are connected by a common header or manifold, through which a fluorinated GHG-containing gas stream originating from one or more fab processes is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. For purposes of this subpart, stack systems do not include emergency vents or bypass stacks through which emissions are not usually vented under typical operating conditions. Trigger point for change out means the residual weight or pressure of a gas container type that a facility uses as an indicator that operators need to change out that gas container with a full container. The trigger point is not the actual residual weight or pressure of the gas remaining in the cylinder that has been replaced. (2) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned from the field. (i) You must determine the flowrate of gas (or volume of gas), partial pressures of condensables, temperature (T), and fluorinated GHG molecular weight (MW<E T=""52"">Fluorinated GHG) at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver. (g) Emissions from venting of residual fluorinated GHGs in containers. If you vent residual fluorinated GHGs from containers, you must either measure the residual fluorinated GHGs vented from each container or develop a heel factor for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type that you vent. You do not need to estimate de minimis emissions associated with good-faith attempts to recycle or recover residual fluorinated GHGs in or from containers. (1) Measuring contents of each container. If you weigh or otherwise measure the contents of each container before venting the residual fluorinated GHGs, use Equation L–32 of this section to calculate annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG from venting of residual fluorinated GHG from containers. Convert pressures to masses as directed in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. (i) Sample size. For each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type that you vent, select a representative sample of containers that reflects the full range of quantities of residual gas returned in that container size and type. This sample must reflect the full range of the industries and a broad range of the customers that use and return the fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type. The minimum sample size for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type must be 30, unless this is greater than the number of containers returned within that combination annually, in which case the contents of every container returned must be measured. (ii) Measurement of residual gas. The residual weight or pressure you use for paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be determined by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your cylinders/containers according to § 98.124(k). If you monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using a form of the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation L–33 of this section, with an appropriately selected Z value. (iii) Heel factor calculation. To determine the heel factor h<E T=""52"">fj for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type, use paragraph (g)(1) of this section to calculate the total heel emissions for each sample selected under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. Divide this total by the number of containers in the sample. Divide the result by the full capacity (the mass of the contents of a full container) of that combination of fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type. The heel factor is expressed as a fraction of the full capacity. (1) Sampling and mass measurement for emission testing. For emission testing in process vents or at the stack, use methods for sampling, measuring volumetric flow rates, non-fluorinated-GHG gas analysis, and measuring stack gas moisture that have been validated using a scientifically sound validation protocol. (ii) Velocity and volumetric flow rates. Acceptable methods include but are not limited to EPA Method 2, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G in Appendix A–1 of 40 CFR part 60. Alternatives that may be used for determining flow rates include OTM–24 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7) and ALT–012 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7). (k) Monitoring for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers. Measure the residual fluorinated GHG in containers received by the facility either using scales or using pressure and temperature measurements. You may use pressure and temperature measurements only in cases where no liquid fluorinated GHG is present in the container. Scales must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent or better of the filled weight (gas plus tare) of the containers of fluorinated GHGs that are typically weighed on the scale. For example, for scales that are generally used to weigh cylinders that contain 115 pounds of gas when full and that have a tare weight of 115 pounds, this equates to ±1 percent of 230 pounds, or ±2.3 pounds. Pressure gauges and thermometers used to measure quantities that are monitored under this paragraph must have an accuracy and precision of ±1 percent of full scale or better. (1) The mass of the residual fluorinated GHG vented from containers annually (metric tons). (2) Identify all batch process vents. (g) Container heel records. If you vent residual fluorinated GHGs from containers, maintain the following records of the measurements and calculations used to estimate emissions of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers. (i) If you measure the contents of each container, maintain records of these measurements and the calculations used to estimate emissions of each fluorinated GHG from each container size and type. (ii) If you develop and apply container heel factors to estimate emissions, maintain records of the measurements and calculations used to develop the heel factor for each fluorinated GHG and each container size and type and of the number of containers of each fluorinated GHG and of each container size and type returned to your facility. (12) If applicable, the heel factor, h<E T=""52"">fj, calculated for each container size and type (decimal fraction) (Equation L–34). (13) If applicable, the number of containers of size and type j returned to the fluorinated gas production facility, N<E T=""52"">fj, (Equation L–34). (14) If applicable, the full capacity of containers of size and type j containing fluorinated GHG f, F<E T=""52"">fj, (metric tons) (Equation L–34). (2) Equipped with a barrier fluid degassing reservoir that is routed to a process or fuel gas system or connected by a closed-vent system to a control device; or In gas and vapor service means that a piece of equipment in regulated material service contains a gas or vapor at operating conditions. (f) The mass of HFC–23 sent off site for sale shall be measured at least weekly (when being packaged) using flowmeters, weigh scales, or a combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and precision of 1.0 percent of full scale or better. (h) The masses of HFC–23 in storage at the beginning and end of the year shall be measured using flowmeters, weigh scales, or a combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and precision of 1.0 percent of full scale or better. (1) Indicate whether the monthly consumption of each gaseous fuel or feedstock is measured as mass or volume (Equation P–1 of § 98.163). (2) Monthly volume of the gaseous fuel or feedstock (scf at standard conditions of 68 °F and atmospheric pressure) (Equation P–1). (6) Indicate whether the monthly consumption of each liquid fuel or feedstock is measured as mass or volume (Equation P–2 of § 98.163). (7) Monthly volume of the liquid fuel or feedstock (gallons of fuel or feedstock) (Equation P–2). (d) If GHG emissions from a taconite indurating furnace, basic oxygen furnace, non-recovery coke oven battery, sinter process, EAF, decarburization vessel, or direct reduction furnace are vented through a stack equipped with a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 methodology in subpart C of this part, or through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO<E T=""52"">2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and comply with all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). (7) If your EAF and decarburization vessel exhaust to a common emission control device and stack, you must sample each process in the ducts before the emissions are combined, sample each process when only one process is operating, or sample the combined emissions when both processes are operating and base the site-specific emission factor on the steel production rate of the EAF. (iii) Annual volume of each gaseous fuel (scf) (Equation Q–1). (v) Molecular weight of each gaseous fuel (kg/kg-mole) (Equation Q–1). (vi) Annual volume of each liquid fuel (gallons) (Equation Q–1). (i) Annual volume of the gaseous fuel (scf) (Equation Q–4 of § 98.173). (xiii) Annual volume of the gaseous fuel (scf at 60F and 1 atm) (Equation Q–5). (xii) Annual mass of each other gaseous output containing carbon produced by each decarburization vessel (metric tons) (Equation Q–6). (i) Annual volume of the gaseous fuel (scf at 68F and 1 atm) (Equation Q–7 of § 98.173). (1) To estimate emissions of cover gases or carrier gases by monitoring changes in container masses and inventories, emissions of each cover gas or carrier gas shall be estimated using Equation T–1 of this section: (2) To estimate emissions of cover gases or carrier gases by monitoring changes in the masses of individual containers as their contents are used, emissions of each cover gas or carrier gas shall be estimated using Equation T–2 of this section: (b) For purposes of Equation T–2 of this section, the mass of the cover gas used over the period p for an individual container shall be estimated by using Equation T–3 of this section: (c) If a facility has mass flow controllers (MFC) and the capacity to track and record MFC measurements to estimate total gas usage, the mass of each cover or carrier gas monitored may be used as the mass of cover or carrier gas consumed (Q<E T=""52"">p), in kg for period p in Equation T–2 of this section. (b) Emissions (consumption) of cover gases and carrier gases may be estimated by monitoring the changes in container weights and inventories using Equation T–1 of this subpart, by monitoring the changes in individual container weights as the contents of each container are used using Equations T–2 and T–3 of this subpart, or by monitoring the mass flow of the pure cover gas or carrier gas into the gas distribution system. Emissions must be estimated at least annually. (c) When estimating emissions by monitoring the mass flow of the pure cover gas or carrier gas into the gas distribution system, you must use gas flow meters, or mass flow controllers, with an accuracy of 1 percent of full scale or better. (d) When estimating emissions using Equation T–1 of this subpart, you must ensure that all the quantities required by Equation T–1 of this subpart have been measured using scales or load cells with an accuracy of 1 percent of full scale or better, accounting for the tare weights of the containers. You may accept gas masses or weights provided by the gas supplier e.g., for the contents of containers containing new gas or for the heels remaining in containers returned to the gas supplier) if the supplier provides documentation verifying that accuracy standards are met; however you remain responsible for the accuracy of these masses or weights under this subpart. (e) When estimating emissions using Equations T–2 and T–3 of this subpart, you must monitor and record container identities and masses as follows: (1) Track the identities and masses of containers leaving and entering storage with check-out and check-in sheets and procedures. The masses of cylinders returning to storage shall be measured immediately before the cylinders are put back into storage. (2) Ensure that all the quantities required by Equations T–2 and T–3 of this subpart have been measured using scales or load cells with an accuracy of 1 percent of full scale or better, accounting for the tare weights of the containers. You may accept gas masses or weights provided by the gas supplier e.g., for the contents of cylinders containing new gas or for the heels remaining in cylinders returned to the gas supplier) if the supplier provides documentation verifying that accuracy standards are met; however, you remain responsible for the accuracy of these masses or weights under this subpart. (c) If the precise before and after weights are not available, it should be assumed that the container was emptied in the process (i.e., quantity purchased should be used, less heel). (d) Cover and carrier gas flow rate (e.g., standard cubic feet per minute) for each production unit and composition in percent by volume. (a) Check-out and weigh-in sheets and procedures for gas cylinders.
