Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors.

13,The applicability tool for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas has an operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons. How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons is determined based on the actual volume of gas vented from the production wells, which is directly related to the barrels of crude oil produced. This correlation is established through the calculation method used, where the operating factor is a function of the crude oil production volume and the amount of associated gas vented. Therefore, as the barrels of crude oil produced increase, the operating factor for associated gas venting is also likely to increase, reflecting the direct relationship between crude oil production and associated gas venting.","ore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting.

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) has a significant impact on emissions estimation and reporting. It allows facilities to use alternative monitoring methods for specific parameters when it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, or operate required monitoring equipment. This flexibility is particularly important for well-related measurement data, specified activity data, and other parameters where the standard monitoring methods are not practical. The use of BAMM also requires thorough documentation and adherence to specific reporting provisions. However, the use of BAMM is subject to time limitations and extension requests, ensuring that facilities eventually transition to standard monitoring and QA/QC requirements. Overall, BAMM provides a practical approach to address challenges in monitoring and estimating emissions, while maintaining the necessary quality assurance and reporting standards.","le methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.

63,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","When a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, there are several options available to determine the GOR for associated gas venting and flaring. Facilities can consider using the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category if GOR from each well is not available. They can also utilize an appropriate standard method published in 40 CFR 98.236(cc) to calculate the gas to oil ratio for the well. Another approach is to use reservoir simulation models to estimate GOR based on reservoir and fluid properties, or to utilize historical GOR data from nearby wells with similar characteristics to make an estimation. Additionally, facilities can conduct a well test to directly measure the GOR. It's important to consult with reservoir engineers and utilize industry best practices to ensure accurate determination of GOR for associated gas venting and flaring.

If the number of years, “n<E T=""52"">new,” in the new cycle is smaller than the number ","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question.,1,"The answer is logically false from the information contained in the context. The text analysis indicates that the monitoring plan that results in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4 and 20% in year five would not be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'",3,0.289017341,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,3,"The answer is partially coherent. While it provides a clear rating scale for coherence, it does not provide any examples or explanations to support the different rating levels. Additionally, the answer could benefit from better organization and flow.",509
