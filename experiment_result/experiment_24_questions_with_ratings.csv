1,Who is required to report under subpart W?,"Entities required to report under subpart W include those estimating CO2 emissions from petroleum products, natural gas liquids, biomass, and feedstocks. They must also retain laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used for estimating CO2 emissions. Additionally, reporters using Calculation Method 1 are obligated to report specific information as outlined in the regulation. The tables provide default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting equipment, and crude oil production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. The data also includes emission factors for natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground gas storage. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also provided for reference.","The entities required to report under subpart W include those who must report information related to estimating CO2 emissions from petroleum products, natural gas liquids, biomass, and feedstocks.

The answer also mentions that reporters using Calculation Method 1 have additional reporting obligations as outlined in the regulation. The answer further provides additional information about default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and processes, as well as the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference.

2,What GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities are covered under the rule?,"The GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities covered under the rule include CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities as specified in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must report emissions only if specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Additionally, onshore natural gas transmission pipeline industry segment must report emissions if specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The emission factors and component counts for different equipment types and geographical regions are also provided for further analysis and reporting of GHG emissions.","Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions as specified in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304.

Facilities covered by this rule might also be required to report emissions under other subparts of the GHG Reporting Program, if applicable.  The GHG Reporting Program requires reporting of GHG emissions: CO2, CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated GHGs: hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases.  These gases are often expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e).",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate description of the GHG emissions covered under the rule, including CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities as specified in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. It also mentions that onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must report emissions only if specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, and onshore natural gas transmission pipeline industry segment must report emissions if specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The answer also notes that emission factors and component counts for different equipment types and geographical regions are provided for further analysis and reporting of GHG emissions.",4,0.425,1,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the GHG emissions covered under the rule, without any indication of uncertainty or lack of knowledge.",5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the GHG emissions covered under the rule, including the types of emissions, facilities, and emission thresholds. It also mentions the availability of emission factors and component counts for further analysis and reporting. Overall, the answer is perfectly coherent and easy to understand.",836,,
3,Will EPA provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule?,"Yes, the EPA will provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule. The facility definition provided in the text indicates that all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, including CO2 EOR operations under common ownership or control, are considered one facility. This tool will help in determining the applicability of the rule to such facilities. Additionally, the table analysis provides detailed population emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions. It also includes average component counts for major equipment and crude oil production equipment in both regions. Furthermore, it presents default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, and leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage. These detailed factors and counts will be essential in utilizing the EPA's tool for assessing applicability under the rule.","Yes, the EPA will provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule.

6,How is the petroleum and natural gas systems source category defined?,"The petroleum and natural gas systems source category encompasses various processes and emission sources involved in petroleum and natural gas production, refining, and distribution. This includes petroleum refineries, importers, exporters of petroleum products, natural gas liquids fractionators, and local natural gas distribution companies. The sources involved are catalytic cracking units, fluid coking units, delayed coking units, catalytic reforming units, coke calcining units, asphalt blowing operations, blowdown systems, storage tanks, process equipment components, marine vessel loading operations, flares, sulfur recovery plants, and non-merchant hydrogen plants. Additionally, it involves reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions in onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The emission factors and component counts for different equipment and materials used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing are also specified for different geographic locations in the Eastern and Western U.S. The reporting requirements are based on emission source types and geographic locations, and the category is defined by the specific processes and emission sources involved.","The petroleum and natural gas systems source category includes petroleum refineries, importers, exporters of petroleum products, natural gas liquids fractionators, and local natural gas distribution companies.

}","Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year must report. The rule defines three different types of facilities. You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",,,5,"The answer provides a comprehensive list of the facilities that must report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems), which includes onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, onshore natural gas processing facilities, underground natural gas storage facilities, onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities, and LNG storage facilities. The additional information provided in the table analysis and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states further supports the accuracy of the answer.",2,0.2149837134,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent as it provides a clear and comprehensive list of facilities that must report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems). Additionally, it includes specific data related to major equipment, valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting facilities in the Eastern and Western U.S., as well as leaker emission factors for compressor components and non-compressor components in gas service at onshore natural gas processing plants. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also included for reference, making the answer well-organized and easy to understand.",877,,
8,What gases must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities?,"Oil and natural gas system facilities must report Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions. Additionally, they must report CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from gas flares, stationary and portable fuel combustion sources, and all other applicable stationary combustion sources. The emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment have been provided, including factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps. The average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment are also included. Furthermore, the emission factors for different survey methods and components in onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage have been outlined. The data is categorized based on the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states, providing a comprehensive overview of emission factors for different equipment and components.","Oil and natural gas system facilities must report Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions.

See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors.

11,When does reporting for subpart W begin?,"The reporting for subpart W begins with the submission of annual GHG reports for the respective reporting years, which include specific information such as the number of days substitute data procedures were used for estimating CO2 emissions of various products. This reporting also entails adherence to specific QA/QC methods for reviewing the completeness and accuracy of reporting. Additionally, the equations provided offer guidance on calculating fuel-specific CO2 emission factors, annual CO2 emissions, and other relevant factors for natural gas, petroleum, and other related processes. The emission factors and equipment data for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as methane and total hydrocarbon emission factors for various equipment and facilities, are also crucial for understanding and reporting under subpart W.","The reporting for subpart W involves reporting the number of days in the reporting year for which substitute data procedures were used for various purposes, including estimating CO2 emissions of petroleum products, natural gas liquids, biomass, and feedstocks. It also requires adherence to specific QA/QC methods for reviewing the completeness and accuracy of reporting. The reporting year for 2011, 2012, and 2013 GHG reports must be submitted by March 31, 2015, containing specific information. Therefore, the reporting for subpart W begins with the submission of annual GHG reports for the respective reporting years.{

}","Starting in 2013 and each year thereafter, reports must be submitted to EPA by March 31 of each year, unless the 31st is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, in which case the reports are due on the next business day.  Facilities subject to subpart W must begin monitoring GHG emissions on January 1, 2011 in accordance with the methods specified in subpart W. For 2012 only, the GHG report must be submitted to EPA by September 28, 2012. This reporting deadline applies to all subparts being reported by the facility. If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, including specific details about the reporting requirements for subpart W, such as the need for annual GHG reports and adherence to QA/QC methods.

14,Where can I find the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production can be found by analyzing the information specified in paragraphs (p)(5)(i) through (iii) and (o)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section. Additionally, the tool should consider the equipment/activities specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (xvii) and (a)(9)(i) through (xi) of this section, and report the information specified in the applicable paragraphs of this section. The tool should also take into account the GHG mole fraction in produced natural gas for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, using the appropriate default whole gas leaker emission factors listed in Table W–1A of this subpart. The tool should calculate CO2, CH4, and N2O combustion-related emissions from stationary or portable equipment, and report the information specified in paragraphs (z)(3) and (4) of this section. Therefore, the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production involves analyzing a wide range of equipment and activities to ensure accurate reporting of emissions. Additionally, specific emission factors and component counts for different locations and equipment types are provided in the tables, which are essential for conducting the emissions analysis and reporting.","The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production can be found by analyzing the information specified in paragraphs (p)(5)(i) through (iii) and (o)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.

15,Does EPA offer guidance on how to estimate a worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for purpose of determining applicability?,"Yes, EPA offers detailed guidance on estimating worst case scenario GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for determining applicability. The calculation method involves using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks and then calculating flashing emissions with software programs such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&P Tank. The parameters for typical operating conditions over the year must be determined by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data. Additionally, the guidance specifies the calculation of CH4 and CO2 annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage, as well as the calculation of CH4, CO2, and N2O annual emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon produced liquids. It also provides methods for calculating CH4 emissions from storage tanks processing unstabilized crude oil and for vented emissions from produced hydrocarbons. In addition to this guidance, there are default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and leaker emission factors provided for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, as well as onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression. The data also includes designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference. Therefore, the EPA guidance and associated data offer comprehensive support for estimating worst case scenario GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for determining applicability.","Yes, EPA offers guidance on how to estimate a worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability.

16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting because the regulations specify different methods for determining volumetric emissions from reciprocating rod packing equipped with an open-ended vent line versus those not equipped with an open-ended vent line. The regulations also outline specific measurement methods for different types of compressor sources, such as blowdown valve leakage and isolation valve leakage. Therefore, the difference in units used for vented emissions is due to the specific measurement and calculation requirements outlined in the regulations for different types of compressor sources and equipment. Additionally, the tables provide detailed emission factors and component counts for different equipment and survey methods, further emphasizing the regulatory differences in measurement and calculation approaches for various components and equipment in different operational scenarios.","In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting because the regulations specify different methods for determining volumetric emissions from reciprocating rod packing equipped with an open-ended vent line versus those not equipped with an open-ended vent line.

It mentions that the regulations specify different methods for determining volumetric emissions from reciprocating rod packing equipped with an open-ended vent line versus those not equipped with an open-ended vent line, and also outline specific measurement methods for different types of compressor sources. The answer also mentions that the difference in units used for vented emissions is due to the specific measurement and calculation requirements outlined in the regulations for different types of compressor sources and equipment. Additionally, the answer provides further details about the emission factors and component counts for different equipment and survey methods, which emphasizes the regulatory differences in measurement and calculation approaches for various components and equipment in different operational scenarios.",2,0.2211538462,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,The answer is mostly coherent and provides a clear explanation of the regulatory differences in measurement and calculation approaches for various components and equipment in different operational scenarios. It also mentions the tables that provide detailed emission factors and component counts for different equipment and survey methods.,1064,,

It explicitly states that external fuel combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu/hr do not need to report combustion emissions or include these emissions for threshold determination in § 98.231(a).,4,0.3538461538,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear and concise response to the question asked. It also includes additional relevant information about the exemption for external combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu/hr and clarifies that the provided tables are not relevant to this exemption.,610,,
21,"My question concerns the calculation of standard temperature and pressure.  The rule stipulates what standard temperature and pressure are, but how, for an annual average, is actual temperature and pressure defined?","The actual temperature and pressure, as defined for §98.233, refer to the 'average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions.' Therefore, for an annual average, the actual temperature and pressure can be defined as the average temperature and pressure at a given location based on annual averages. This definition allows for the consideration of variations in temperature and pressure over time and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental conditions for regulatory and operational purposes. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities, which are essential for assessing and managing environmental impacts associated with natural gas and petroleum production, gathering, and processing. These factors and counts contribute to the overall understanding of emissions and environmental performance in the respective regions of the Eastern and Western U.S.","Actual temperature and pressure as defined for §98.233 is the 'average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions.' Therefore, the average temperature and pressure at a given location based on annual averages can be used for actual temperature and actual pressure.{

The equations include conversion factors, molecular weights, emission factors, and various other parameters related to the calculation of emissions and environmental impacts. The requests for verification ask for confirmation of the precision or version of certain documents.

22,Should self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W?,"Based on the information provided, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W, especially in the context of well workovers with hydraulic fracturing. The process of well workovers, including high-rate flowback and venting of produced gas, falls under the scope of emissions reporting. Therefore, these activities should be considered for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment are essential for calculating and reporting GHG emissions accurately. The population emission factors for various components and survey methods are also crucial in determining the total hydrocarbon emissions. All of these factors and data should be taken into account when reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W.","Based on the information provided, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W, especially in the context of well workovers with hydraulic fracturing.

23,How do I define a facility under subpart W? Are all industry segments included in one annual GHG report?,"A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties emitting or capable of emitting any greenhouse gas. This includes electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment, natural gas distribution pipelines, carbon dioxide production wells, cement production facilities, ethanol plants, and more. Therefore, not all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report as each facility has specific reporting requirements based on its operations and emissions. The provided tables contain detailed population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing equipment, as well as natural gas transmission compression and underground gas storage. These tables provide specific data for different components and services, further emphasizing the specific reporting requirements for each facility based on its operations and emissions.","A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties emitting or capable of emitting any greenhouse gas.

24,What emissions are reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities?,"Petroleum and natural gas system facilities are required to report annual CO2 and CH4 emissions resulting from venting gas directly to the atmosphere. The reported emissions must be in metric tons of CO2 and CH4 and must be associated with the unit or operation from which they originated. The emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and distribution are provided in the tables. These factors include population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and methane emission factors for different equipment and material types, as well as for specific services such as gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service, and LNG storage. The data is further categorized based on geographical regions such as Eastern U.S. and Western U.S. The emission factors provided in the tables can be used to calculate and report the CO2 and CH4 emissions from petroleum and natural gas system facilities.","Petroleum and natural gas system facilities must report annual CO2 and CH4 emissions resulting from venting gas directly to the atmosphere.

}","Facilities in petroleum and natural gas systems are required to report emissions from combustion, venting, equipment leaks, and flaring.  The exact list of equipment is specified in the regulatory requirements at 40 CFR 98.232 and is specific to each petroleum and natural gas systems industry segment covered by the GHGRP.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the emissions reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities. It includes the required annual CO2 and CH4 emissions resulting from venting gas directly to the atmosphere, the metric tons in which they must be reported, and the need for association with the unit or operation from which they originated. The answer also mentions the various emission factors provided in the tables for different equipment and material types, as well as for specific services such as gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service, and LNG storage. The data is further categorized based on geographical regions such as Eastern U.S. and Western U.S. The answer concludes by stating that the emission factors provided in the tables can be used to calculate and report the CO2 and CH4 emissions from petroleum and natural gas system facilities.",1,"The provided answer contains information about the emissions reported for petroleum and natural gas system facilities, but it also includes information about emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and distribution. This information is not directly related to the question about emissions reported for petroleum and natural gas system facilities.",2,0.2694300518,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and provides a comprehensive explanation of the emissions reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities.

}","No, the GHGRP does not cover all emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems.  For example, facilities included in the petroleum and natural gas systems source category are required to submit annual reports only if the facility's total annual emissions from all sources covered by the GHGRP exceed 25,000 metric tons CO2e.",,,5,"The answer provides clear and direct evidence from the CONTEXT that the current GHGRP data includes U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems. The provided information on the emissions of CH4 from petroleum and natural gas systems, equipment types, service, fluorinated GHG concentrations, time periods in service, population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states all support the inclusion of U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems in the GHGRP data.",1,0.2769230769,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear and comprehensive explanation that the current GHGRP data includes U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems. The answer also cites supporting evidence from the provided tables, which further confirms the inclusion of such emissions in the GHGRP data.",633,,
27,What percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP?,"The percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP depends on whether the specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, as per the regulations. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts provided in the tables can be used to calculate the total emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering/boosting equipment. By applying these factors to the component counts, the total emissions can be estimated, and then compared to the reporting threshold to determine the percentage of emissions reported under the GHGRP.","Facilities must report emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment only if emission sources specified in § 98.232(j) emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. Therefore, the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP depends on whether the specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, as per the regulations.{

}","EPA does not have an exact estimate of what percent of U.S. emissions are covered under petroleum and natural gas systems at this time.  The petroleum and natural gas systems source category (Subpart W) requires reporting from facilities above an emissions threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e.  It is difficult to quantify what net emissions occurr below the threshold.  In addition, facilities below the threshold may not be directly comparable to facilities over the emission threshold due to differences in the types of emission sources covered.  EPA will continue to analyze the emissions from reports as well as linking the information to the US GHG Inventory to identify what fraction of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are covered by the GHGRP.",4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP depends on the specified emission sources and the reporting threshold. It also mentions the use of emission factors and component counts to estimate total emissions and calculate the percentage reported. However, it does not provide any specific numerical value for the percentage, which would have made the answer more complete.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP is determined.

28,"How does EPA define a ""facility"" for petroleum and natural gas systems?",No answer found,No context found,The definition of facility depends on each segment and the proximity of emission sources to one another.  Generally under the GHGRP a facility is all co-located emission sources that are commonly owned or operated (see the definition of “facility” in 40 CFR 98.6 for more details).,1,The answer completely lacks relevance as it does not provide any information related to the question.,1,"The answer is not provided, therefore it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.0,5,The answer straightforwardly says that it doesn't know and makes no attempt to answer the question.,1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the question asked.,15,,

This includes onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment. The facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions as specified in the regulations. Additionally, the provided input contains a mix of LaTeX equations and text related to various conversion factors, emission factors, and other parameters used in environmental regulations. The equations include factors such as molecular weights, conversion from kilograms to metric tons, and emission factors for different types of greenhouse gases.

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) provided facilities with the flexibility to estimate emissions for specific time periods when required measurement data could not reasonably be obtained. This was particularly useful for parameters such as fuel use, feedstock rates, and well-related measurement data. However, the use of BAMM was subject to specific time limitations and required approval from the Administrator. Facilities were able to utilize calculation methodologies and equations specified in the regulations, and they could also submit requests for extensions beyond certain dates. The use of BAMM allowed for flexibility in estimating emissions when standard monitoring methods were not feasible, but it was closely regulated and necessitated thorough documentation and approval. Additionally, the integration of equations and variables provided a structured approach to emission estimation, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the estimates. The emission factors and component counts for different equipment and materials in both the Eastern and Western U.S. further contributed to the comprehensive monitoring and estimation of emissions in the petroleum and natural gas production and gathering sectors.","The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) allowed facilities to estimate emissions for specific time periods when required measurement data could not reasonably be obtained according to monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

Overall, the answer is mostly relevant to the question and provides useful information.",5,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of how the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affected emissions. It mentions that BAMM provided flexibility in estimating emissions when standard monitoring methods were not feasible, and that it was closely regulated and required thorough documentation and approval. The answer also notes that the integration of equations and variables provided a structured approach to emission estimation, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the estimates. Finally, the answer mentions that the emission factors and component counts for different equipment and materials in both the Eastern and Western U.S. further contributed to the comprehensive monitoring and estimation of emissions in the petroleum and natural gas production and gathering sectors. All of this information logically follows from the information provided in the context, so the answer receives a score of 5.",3,0.3545150502,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear explanation of how the use of BAMM allowed facilities to estimate emissions for specific time periods when required measurement data could not reasonably be obtained.

}","The GHGRP covers the same sources of emissions in California as CARB, but there are differences in the reporting thresholds as well as how facilities are defined.  CARB has a different definition for onshore production facilities than the GHGRP.  The practical implication is that individual CARB facilities reporting under onshore production may be larger than comparable GHGRP facilities.  However, there will be more facilities in the GHGRP, and those facilities will cover the same emissions as the smaller number of CARB facilities.  It is not expected that the total emissions covered will be different between the GHGRP and CARB.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the GHG emissions data reported under the GHGRP for petroleum and natural gas systems is subject to specific monitoring, reporting, and QA/QC requirements as specified in 30 CFR 250 and § 98.2(a)(4) of the CARB. However, it does not directly compare the data reported under the GHGRP to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which was the main focus of the question.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate comparison between the GHG emissions data reported under the GHGRP for petroleum and natural gas systems and the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB). It also includes relevant information about the monitoring, reporting, and QA/QC requirements for the reported data, as well as the specific information that must be reported for onshore facilities. Additionally, the answer provides a comprehensive list of emission factors for various components and equipment types, which is relevant to the question and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic.",1,0.08630394,,,4,"The answer provides a clear comparison between the GHG emissions data reported under the GHGRP for petroleum and natural gas systems and the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB).

The facility must also use the appropriate default whole gas population emission factors listed in Table W–1A of this subpart, and indicate whether they elected to comply with § 98.233(q) according to § 98.233(q)(1)(iv) for any equipment components at the facility. Additionally, the notification requirements involve reporting specific emissions and complying with the relevant emission factors and compliance options. The emission factors and component counts for different equipment types and services are provided in the tables, along with population emission factors for various components and survey methods.

The calculated emissions must be documented with the information and data used for the calculation. Additionally, the provided tables contain population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and leaker emission factors for various components and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression. These tables can be used to estimate emissions based on the specific components and services involved in the operations.

It states that standard simulation software packages like AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4679 AMINECalc can be used, and that the actual temperature and pressure should be determined for typical operating conditions over the calendar year by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data. The answer also mentions that the calculated emissions must be documented with the information and data used for the calculation. Additionally, it acknowledges the presence of tables containing population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and leaker emission factors for various components and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression, which can be used to estimate emissions based on the specific components and services involved in the operations.

39,How does this final rule relate to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program?,"The final rule specifies that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Additionally, the rule requires natural gas distribution facilities to use appropriate methane emission factors as described in the section. Therefore, the final rule directly relates to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program by regulating the reporting and monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas distribution facilities. The provided tables contain data on emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting. These factors are essential for calculating and monitoring emissions as per the final rule's requirements. The equations mentioned in the text analysis are related to environmental emissions calculations, including factors for different substances, molecular weights, emission factors, and mass or volume of emissions from different processes. This comprehensive approach aligns with the goal of the final rule to regulate and monitor greenhouse gas emissions effectively.","The final rule specifies that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

This is supported by the specified reporting requirements for emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment integral to the extraction, processing, or movement of oil or natural gas, as well as the reporting requirements for petrochemical process units and combustion emissions. Additionally, the table analysis provides detailed population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, further confirming the applicability of the rule to both onshore and offshore facilities.",5,0.3356643357,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,,,699,,
43,"Are sites in south Louisiana located within the State boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous (not in Federal waters but subject to the ebb and flow of the tide) considered to be seaward of the terrestrial border and thus offshore?","Based on the provided information, sites in south Louisiana located within the State boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous (not in Federal waters but subject to the ebb and flow of the tide) are considered offshore as they fall within the definition of offshore production facilities. Therefore, they are seaward of the terrestrial border and subject to the jurisdiction and control of the United States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The table data provides emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S., as well as the designation of states in each region. However, this data does not directly impact the classification of sites in south Louisiana as offshore within the context of the original question.","Based on the provided information, sites in south Louisiana located within the State boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous (not in Federal waters but subject to the ebb and flow of the tide) are considered offshore as they fall within the definition of offshore production facilities.

                        ""Population Emission Factors—Other Components","BOEMRE typically publishes a GOADS study after March 31 of the year following the data collection.  Therefore, for Subpart W, offshore reporters subject to BOEMRE must use the latest BOEMRE published emissions data (which may be 2008, as the 2011 GOADS report may not be available).  As a further clarification, the reporters will report under Subpart W using the BOEMRE methodologies published in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 with the latest BOEMRE emissions data.  In subsequent years, reporters in state and non-Gulf of Mexico waters will report using the GOADS methodologies published in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304, which historically have been published along with the GOADS emissions data.",,,5,The answer directly states that the 2011 BOEMRE data should be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from the offshore facility and provides additional information about default factors that can be used in conjunction with the BOEMRE data to accurately calculate and report the emissions.,4,0.2986425339,1,"The answer provides a clear and specific response to the question, without any indication of uncertainty.",5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise response to the question, citing the relevant BOEMRE data and explaining how it should be used to report RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility. Additionally, the answer mentions the availability of default emission factors and component counts that can be used in conjunction with the BOEMRE data to accurately calculate and report the emissions. Overall, the answer is easy to follow and provides all the necessary information in a coherent manner.",922,,
48,"If an offshore oil and gas production platform or facility is farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, does that facility have to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C?","Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for offshore petroleum and natural gas production from all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. Therefore, if an offshore oil and gas production platform or facility is farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, it must report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as information on leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors for various equipment and services. However, the provided formula analysis did not yield relevant equations related to the question. Therefore, based on the text and table analysis, it is clear that offshore oil and gas production facilities must report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C if they are beyond the limit of state waters.","Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for offshore petroleum and natural gas production from all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304.

49,By when do onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report?,"Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report emissions from specific source types on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, while offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE. The reporting obligations also include information specified in paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section for each major equipment type, production type, and geographic location combination. Additionally, there are specific emission factors and component counts provided for different locations and equipment types, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and more, which are used to calculate emissions. These factors and counts vary based on the location and type of equipment. Therefore, onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W have detailed reporting and calculation obligations for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions as outlined in the regulations.","Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

}","Therefore, if the facility is subject to the rule and is under BOEMRE jurisdiction but is a new facility that is not included in the most recently published GOADs report, then you must calculate calendar year 2011 emissions for equipment leaks, vent, and flare emission sources using the GOADS methodologies in the most recently published GOADS report. New facilities, whether or not under GOADS jurisdiction, have to follow 98.233(s)(4), which states, “For either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions.”",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, addressing all aspects of the question and providing additional relevant information. The answer also references the necessary tables and methodologies for accurate calculation and reporting of emissions for offshore facilities subject to GOADS in 2012.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context. It clearly states that offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the most recent monitoring methods and calculation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 250.304 to calculate and report annual emissions. Therefore, yes, offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the GOADS methodologies to calculate the emissions in 2012. The answer also provides additional information about the default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, and whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, which can be used in conjunction with the GOADS methodologies to accurately calculate and report the emissions for offshore facilities in 2012.",3,0.3839285714,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise response to the question, explaining that offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE to calculate and report annual emissions. It also mentions the availability of default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, and whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, which can be used in conjunction with the GOADS methodologies to accurately calculate and report the emissions for offshore facilities in 2012.

52,Are the emissions factors listed in Table W-1A for both leaking components and non-leaking components? How do you calculate emissions from leaking components if onshore petroleum and natural gas source are not required to monitor components?,"{'answer': 'The content does not explicitly mention separate emission factors for leaking and non-leaking components. However, the emission factors provided in the tables are categorized based on different components and services, such as gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service, and gathering pipelines. The emission factors are specified for various components like valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps. Additionally, there are specific emission factors provided for leaker components under different survey methods. The emission factors are expressed in units such as scf/hour/component, indicating the emission rate for leaking components. Therefore, to calculate emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources, one would use the specific leaker emission factors provided in the table based on the survey method used.'}","The emission factors for petroleum products and natural gas liquids are determined using calculation methods described in paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section. The calculation method involves using default carbon share factors, default CO2 emission factors, direct measurements of density and carbon share, and Equation MM–6 for solid products. Additionally, site-specific emission factors can be calculated for the process in metric tons of CO2 per metric ton of feed or production.

}","Equipment leak emissions in onshore production are to be estimated using methods provided in 98.233(r)(2).  Hence, no leak detection of emissions is required for onshore production.  Table W-1A provides population emission factors, which represent the emissions on an average from the entire population of components – both leaking and non-leaking; please see section 6(d) of the Technical Support Document (http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_TSD.pdf) for further details on the concept of population emission factors.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the content does not explicitly mention separate emission factors for leaking and non-leaking components. The answer also correctly identifies that emission factors are provided for various components and services, and specific emission factors are provided for leaker components under different survey methods.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to monitor and regulate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. This reporting allows the EPA to track and manage greenhouse gas emissions from the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas, including associated storage or measurement vessels. The reporting also covers enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations using CO2 or natural gas injection. The regulation aims to ensure transparency and accountability in the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production across different basins. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, which are essential for understanding and managing the environmental impact of these operations.","The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to monitor and regulate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

                       ","When the GHGRP requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production were proposed, EPA’s goal was to provide a facility definition that all producers could directly apply, and that would be both practical and cost-effective.  EPA sought public comment on a range of possible options for defining the facility that would report with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, ranging from defining the facility at the individual well pad, to defining the facility at the field-level, to defining the facility at the basin-level.  Taking into account public comment, EPA finalized the definition of facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production using a basin-level approach because the operational boundaries and basin demarcations are clearly defined and are widely known, and the approach covered most emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin.

65,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my oil well operations to decide whether I need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations and decide whether to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing, the average gas to oil ratio in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil can be calculated using Equation W–18 of the specified subpart. If the GOR from each well is not available, the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category can be used. Additionally, it is necessary to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing if the GOR is 300 scf/STB or greater. This determination can be made by calculating the GOR for each well and comparing it to the threshold of 300 scf/STB. The provided tables contain emission factors and component counts that can be used in the calculation and reporting process.","The gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations can be determined by calculating the average gas to oil ratio, in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil, as specified in Equation W–18 of this subpart. If the GOR from each well is not available, the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category can be used. Additionally, for well venting during well completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing that have a GOR of 300 scf/STB or greater, emissions must be reported. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is necessary to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing if the GOR is 300 scf/STB or greater.{

66,How should a gathering and boosting facility that previously reporting under Subpart C report in RY2016?,"For RY2016, the gathering and boosting facility that previously reported under Subpart C should report the quantity of gas received by the facility in the calendar year, in thousand standard cubic feet. Additionally, the facility must report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment integral to the movement of natural gas, such as dehydrators, compressors, generators, boilers, and heaters, following the requirements specified in § 98.236(z) and not according to the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part. Therefore, the facility should report the gas quantity received and the specified emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment for RY2016. The emission factors and component counts for different equipment in the gathering and boosting facility are provided in the tables, which can be used for calculating the emissions as per the reporting requirements.","For RY2016, the gathering and boosting facility that previously reported under Subpart C should report the quantity of gas received by the facility in the calendar year, in thousand standard cubic feet.

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, you can use the average GOR values used in Equation W–18 of this subpart, which is measured in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil. The GOR can be calculated for each well tested, and if the GOR from each well is not available, you can use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category. Additionally, if GOR cannot be determined from available data, specific procedures specified in the regulations must be followed to determine the GOR. Therefore, based on the provided regulations, you can determine the GOR for your gathering pipelines using the average GOR values from tested wells or clusters of wells in the same sub-basin category. In addition, the population emission factors for gathering pipelines by material type in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, which can be used in conjunction with the GOR calculations. Furthermore, the default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment are available for the Eastern and Western U.S., which can aid in the overall assessment and determination of the GOR for gathering pipelines.","To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, you can use the average GOR values used in Equation W–18 of this subpart, which is measured in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil.

This process includes the extraction of NGLs from produced natural gas and their subsequent separation into distinct products. It is important to note that plants that only process natural gas without further fractionating NGLs are not considered fractionators. NGL fractionators are required to adhere to specific procedures such as reporting quantities of constituents of mixtures or blends separately, using measurement for NGLs at custody transfer meters, and determining quantity based on meter records provided by pipelines or manifests for deliveries. Additionally, they are required to use specific calculation methods and report detailed information in their annual reports as per the regulations.

}","If a membrane unit is used to remove CO2 from natural gas containing concentrations of hydrogen sulfide or carbon dioxide that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable nature gas, then emissions must be calculated and reported as specified in §98.233 (d), as this process meets the definition of acid gas removal unit in §98.238.  Please see EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1298-18 in the Response To Comments (1719 - 1720) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf for further details on the definitions of sweet and sour gas.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by stating that vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O from specified sources. It also includes additional information about the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas and facility specific residue gas that must be reported, as well as the various emission factors and components that play a crucial role in understanding and reporting vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing.",2,0.2201834862,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of where vent emissions are reported for onshore natural gas processing. It includes all the necessary information and presents it in a coherent and natural way, making it easy to understand and follow. Therefore, the answer has perfect coherency and deserves a rating of five stars.",1073,,
73,"In 98.230(a)(3), is 25 mmscf per day the design capacity for a processing plant or the actual capacity?","The text analysis indicates that the specific regulation, § 98.230(a)(3), does not directly specify whether 25 mmscf per day is the design capacity for a processing plant or the actual capacity. However, the applicable records specified in §§ 98.34(f), 98.35(b), and 98.36(e) are required, along with the use of an industry standard practice as described in § 98.234(b). The table analysis provides detailed data on emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. While the table data offers valuable insights into emission factors and equipment counts, it does not directly address the specific capacity designation of 25 mmscf per day for a processing plant. Therefore, based on the available analyses, the exact designation of 25 mmscf per day as the design or actual capacity for a processing plant remains inconclusive and may require further specific information or clarification.","The records required by § 98.230(a)(3) include the applicable records specified in §§ 98.34(f), 98.35(b), and 98.36(e). It also mentions using an industry standard practice as described in § 98.234(b). However, it does not directly specify whether 25 mmscf per day is the design capacity for a processing plant or the actual capacity.{

74,"If a natural gas processing plant is co-located with an underground storage facility and they share compression, can they report as one combined facility?","Yes, a natural gas processing plant co-located with an underground storage facility and sharing compression can report as one combined facility. The underground natural gas storage includes compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, and the natural gas processing plant includes all residue gas compression equipment. Therefore, they can be considered as one facility for reporting purposes. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, along with default emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps. The default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression, as well as underground natural gas storage, are also included. Furthermore, population emission factors for different components and survey methods are detailed, along with methane population emission factors for LNG storage. This comprehensive data can aid in understanding and reporting emissions from the combined facility.","Yes, a natural gas processing plant co-located with an underground storage facility and sharing compression can report as one combined facility.

77,Are facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams (and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane) subject to subpart W?,"Facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W. This is based on the definition of fractionators as plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products. It is mentioned that plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Additionally, the emission factor tables provide specific population emission factors for different components and services, but they do not directly impact the determination of subpart W applicability for the described facilities.","Facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W. The text mentions that 'Fractionators means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators.'

If the annual average throughput of the natural gas processing plant meets or exceeds 25 MMscf per day, then it meets the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts for major equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. are available for further analysis and compliance considerations.","To calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, you should consider the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater as the threshold. This means that if the annual average throughput of the natural gas processing plant is 25 MMscf per day or greater, then it meets the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants.{

The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and the frequency with which facilities must re-evaluate whether they fall below this threshold.

This means that the requirements of the applicable subpart (subpart W) are crucial for determining the applicability of a natural gas processing facility. Additionally, the table analysis provides specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment and facilities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production. These details can be used to assess and calculate the emissions and components associated with natural gas processing facilities, further supporting the determination of Subpart W applicability.'}","According to the provided text, if a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence.

   ","Since the throughput of the facility was identified in the question as 30 MMscf per day throughput capacity, this exceeds the exclusion identified in the §98.230(a)(3) for processing facilities that do not fractionate.  Therefore, this facility falls under the onshore natural gas processing industry segment definition as defined in §98.230(a)(3) and these emissions would be included in the applicability determination for your facility.  (If the throughput were less than 25 MMscf this source would not have been considered in the applicability determination for the facility.)  However, based on the information provided, since the processing facility has less than 25,000 metric tons CO2e in combined emissions from stationary combustion, flaring, vented, and fugitive sources, the facility does not need to report under subpart W.  Both the 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold (from §98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day annual average throughput (from §98.230(a)(3)) are considered when determining subpart W applicability for a natural gas processing facility.",5,"The answer accurately states that the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold and the 25 MMscf per day throughput specified in subpart W take precedence over subpart A for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility.

81,May engineering calculations be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product?,"Based on the regulations and engineering calculations, flare gas composition can be used in equations W-19 through W-21 for a flared stream that is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer, as well as hydrocarbon product. The regulations allow for the use of representative composition from the source for the stream determined by engineering calculation based on process knowledge and best available data when the stream going to the flare is a hydrocarbon product. Additionally, the provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, which can be utilized in the engineering calculations for determining flare gas composition.","Yes, engineering calculations may be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions lies in the use of continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS). In 98.233(k), CEMS are used to quantify CO2 mass emissions, while in 98.234(a)(1), CEMS are used to monitor CH4 concentration, temperature, pressure, and moisture content of the biogas collected and routed to a destruction device. For intermittent emissions from the storage tank, the methodology for calculating total emissions must be documented, and emissions must be estimated at least annually. An alternative method to quantify the emissions can be used if it meets the applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements. Additionally, the provided tables offer population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and leaker emission factors for different components and services, which can be utilized to assess and quantify emissions in compliance with the regulatory requirements.","The difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions lies in the use of continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS).

                ""title","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, as well as the requirements for treating intermittent emissions and using alternative methods to quantify emissions. The answer also mentions the availability of relevant tables for assessing and quantifying emissions in compliance with regulatory requirements.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, as well as the requirements for calculating total emissions for intermittent emissions from the storage tank and the possibility of using an alternative method to quantify the emissions. The answer also mentions the availability of tables with population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for different components and services, which can be used to comply with regulatory requirements.",1,0.2647058824,1,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, as well as how to treat intermittent emissions from the storage tank and the possibility of using alternative methods to quantify emissions. There is no uncertainty or lack of knowledge conveyed in the answer.",4,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, as well as the methodology for calculating total emissions for intermittent emissions from the storage tank.

86,"For transmission tank venting sent to the flare, the reporter is referred to the emissions source for flare stack emissions, but guidance is only provided for upstream production and gas processing in this section.","The guidance for transmission tank venting sent to the flare is indeed provided in the text. It specifies that if scrubber dump valve leakage occurred for a transmission storage tank vent stack and the vent stack vented to a flare during the calendar year, then specific information must be reported. Additionally, the calculation method of flare stacks is mentioned to determine storage tank emissions sent to a flare. This guidance is supported by the table data, which includes emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting. The table also provides average component counts for major equipment and designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. Furthermore, leaker emission factors for different survey methods and leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground gas storage are included in the table data. The table also contains population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression and methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage.","Yes, there is guidance provided for transmission tank venting sent to the flare. The text specifies that if scrubber dump valve leakage occurred for a transmission storage tank vent stack and the vent stack vented to a flare during the calendar year, then specific information must be reported. Additionally, the calculation method of flare stacks is mentioned to determine storage tank emissions sent to a flare.

89,How does a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability?,"In the context of onshore natural gas transmission compression, the determination of subpart applicability involves reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the sources specified in the regulations. The emissions are to be calculated using specific equations and methods outlined in the regulations for different equipment types and event types. Therefore, the determination of subpart applicability for a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator involves assessing the emissions from various equipment components and following the reporting requirements outlined in the regulations. The emission factors and component counts for different equipment types and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided in the tables. These factors and counts are essential for calculating and reporting emissions. Additionally, specific leaker emission factors and population emission factors for different components and services are also available, which are crucial for determining subpart applicability and reporting requirements.","In the context of onshore natural gas transmission compression, the determination of subpart applicability involves reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the sources specified in the regulations.

91,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"Unintentional natural gas releases, including those resulting from accidental releases, are indeed subject to reporting. The text analysis confirms that unintentional releases are covered, and the table analysis provides specific emission factors and component counts for various equipment and gas services, further supporting the reporting requirements for unintentional natural gas releases.","Yes, unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases are subject to reporting. The text mentions intentional or designed releases of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas, but it also includes information about vented emissions from equipment leaks, blowdown for maintenance, and direct venting of gas used to power equipment. Additionally, it specifies reporting requirements for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, pneumatic device venting, blowdown vent stack emissions, and well venting for liquids unloading. Therefore, based on the information provided, unintentional natural gas releases are indeed subject to reporting.{

This determination is supported by the emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as the leaker emission factors for various components. Additionally, the designation of the Eastern and Western U.S. does not impact the classification of the storage as an underground facility. Therefore, the data and regulations support the clarification that the high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should not be classified as an underground natural gas storage facility.","The natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W.{

94,"What is the definition of ""facility"" for underground storage?","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage is comprehensive and covers various aspects of equipment and operations related to underground storage. It includes any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. This definition also encompasses onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, CO2 EOR operations, and all gathering pipelines and other equipment located along those pipelines that are under common ownership or control by a gathering and boosting system owner or operator within a single hydrocarbon basin. Additionally, it takes into account the emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and gathering and boosting equipment. The definition also provides leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas processing, natural gas transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage, offering a comprehensive framework for regulating emissions and equipment standards.","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage includes any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. This definition also encompasses onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or control, including leased, rented, or contracted activities.

96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"Natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment because the regulations specify the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service. These emission factors are listed in Table W–4A and Table W–4B to this subpart. Therefore, the regulations do not differentiate between compressor and non-compressor components for emission factors in underground natural gas storage facilities. Additionally, the emission factors for various components in different services and regions are provided in the tables, outlining the population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for different equipment and facilities related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, and storage.","The reason natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment is because the regulations specify the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service.

97,Does Subpart W require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility or does reporting start only when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage?,"Subpart W requires reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources, underground natural gas storage facilities, and onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The reporting starts from the first 6 months of required data collection, and facilities must use best engineering estimates for any data related to newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured. Therefore, reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility is required under Subpart W. The provided table data includes emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. However, the specific relevance of this table data to the reporting requirements under Subpart W is not explicitly mentioned.","Subpart W requires reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources, underground natural gas storage facilities, and onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.

They must also report emissions from stationary and portable fuel combustion sources, as well as emissions from all other applicable stationary combustion sources. The facility should comply with the monitoring and QA/QC requirements as set forth in the regulations. The facility must also calculate CO2, CH4, and N2O combustion-related emissions from stationary or portable equipment. The answer provided in the input matches the information provided in the context, hence the score is 5.",2,0.0670220868,,,4,"The answer provides relevant information about the reporting requirements for emissions related to the facility's operations, as well as the calculation requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary or portable equipment.

100,Are dehydration units that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility?,"Yes, dehydrators used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are indeed included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility. The regulations specify reporting requirements for dehydrators based on their annual average daily natural gas throughput, use of desiccant, and the calculation methods for emissions. Additionally, the provided tables offer detailed information on emission factors for various components and equipment related to natural gas production, gathering, processing, and storage. This comprehensive data further supports the inclusion of dehydrators in the definition of underground natural gas storage facilities, as it covers emission factors for components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and more, which are relevant to the operation of dehydrators within the storage facility.","Yes, dehydrators that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility. The regulations specify reporting requirements for dehydrators based on their annual average daily natural gas throughput, use of desiccant, and the calculation methods for emissions. The content also provides details about the calculation of annual mass emissions from glycol dehydrators and the specific parameters to be determined for characterizing emissions from dehydrators. Therefore, based on the information provided, dehydrators used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are indeed covered within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility.{

The additional information provided about emission factors and component counts is for context only and does not change the specific requirement for reporting leakage.,4,0.248447205,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-written and coherent. It provides a clear and concise response to the question, citing the relevant information from the provided tables. The answer also acknowledges the additional context provided by the emission factors and component counts, but correctly identifies the specific requirement for reporting leakage as pertaining only to the equipment listed in Table W-5. Overall, the answer demonstrates a high level of coherence and understanding of the topic.",418,,
102,Do I have to calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals?,"Yes, you are required to calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals. The calculation method involves using operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks, and flashing emissions must be calculated using software programs such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&P Tank. Additionally, specific parameters must be determined for typical operating conditions over the year to characterize emissions from liquid transferred to tanks. It is also important to consider the appropriate default methane leaker emission factors and methane population emission factors for LNG storage components. Therefore, the regulations clearly mandate the calculation of emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at the mentioned facilities. The default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, methane population emission factors, and methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage, import, and export equipment are provided to aid in the calculation process.","Yes, you are required to calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals.

A pressure relief valve is a special type of valve and falls in the category of ""other,"" so this emission source is included in the leak detection survey and required to be reported.  Regarding your first question: sections 98.232(g) and 98.232(h) do no include venting from LNG storage tanks as an emission source; therefore venting emissions from LNG storage tank are not required for LNG storage or for LNG import and export equipment.  However, if the LNG storge tank is blown down to atmosphere, then section 98.232(h) does require reporting.",,,5,"The context clearly states that emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals must be calculated. The answer provides a detailed explanation of the calculation method, including the use of software programs and specific parameters to determine emissions. It also mentions the importance of considering appropriate default methane leaker emission factors and methane population emission factors for LNG storage components. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",2,0.3237410072,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,,,1184,,

105,"At LNG Storage sites, how should pumps that are internal and submerged be treated?","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated as pumps designed with no externally actuated shaft penetrating the pump housing. These pumps are used to raise pressure, drive, or increase flow of liquid streams in closed or open conduits. Additionally, dual mechanical seal pumps and absorbent circulation pumps may also be used at LNG storage sites. The specific treatment and maintenance requirements for these pumps should be in accordance with the regulations and guidelines for equipment used in LNG storage facilities. Furthermore, the emission factors for various components in gas service and crude oil service, as well as the average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering, are provided for Eastern and Western U.S. locations. Additionally, leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors for natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground storage, and LNG storage are available for reference.","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated as pumps designed with no externally actuated shaft penetrating the pump housing.

108,"For a liquefied natural gas import facility, do boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported?","Based on the text analysis, boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported. This includes intentional or designed releases of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas, such as LNG boil-off gas, which vents from LNG storage tanks due to ambient heat leakage through the tank insulation and heat energy dissipated in the LNG by internal pumps. Additionally, the table analysis provides detailed emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities related to natural gas production, gathering, and processing. While the specific emission factors for LNG storage are not explicitly mentioned, the data can be used to calculate and report the boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank.","Yes, boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported. Vented emissions include intentional or designed releases of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas, such as LNG boil-off gas, which vents from LNG storage tanks due to ambient heat leakage through the tank insulation and heat energy dissipated in the LNG by internal pumps.{

The answer fully addresses the main aspects of the question based on the context.",5,"The context explicitly states that boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported, including intentional or designed releases of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas, such as LNG boil-off gas, which vents from LNG storage tanks due to ambient heat leakage through the tank insulation and heat energy dissipated in the LNG by internal pumps. The answer accurately summarizes this information and provides additional details from the table analysis to support the conclusion that boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported.",1,0.3026315789,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any indication of uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the need to report boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank, including the specific types of emissions that need to be reported.

                        ""Low Continuous Bleed","For natural gas distribution, a facility, which is the collection of all distribution pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by an LDC, is required to do at least one facility wide leak detection survey per calendar year and has the option to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys; if the facility selects this option, the additional facility-wide survey(s) must be completed during the same calendar year in order to account for fixing one or more leaks in the annual GHG report.  If the facility chooses to fix one or more leaks and conduct another survey to determine that the component is not leaking, it must conduct a facility wide leak detection survey in order to account for fixing the leak(s) in the annual GHG report.  As leaks are random in nature and while some leaks are fixed others are likely to occur.  Therefore, a comprehensive survey is the only statistically relevant manner by which to establish facility-wide leak emissions rates and account for leaks repaired.  Please see the response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1014-9 (Response to Comments, pp. 1281-1282, http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf) for further details.  It is very important to note that the requirement to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys should a company wish to account for fixing a leak does not preclude in any way a company from repairing a leak.  If a company chooses to conduct only one facility-wide leak detection survey in a calendar year but finds a leak during the survey, the company can and is encouraged to fix the leak.  The leak detected though, as noted above, must be reported as a leaker for the entire calendar year should the company choose not to conduct a second survey.",,,5,"The answer clearly states that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year. If multiple surveys are conducted, the results from each survey must be used for emissions calculations. Additionally, facilities must indicate the number of years in the leak survey cycle if performing equipment leak surveys across a multiple-year cycle. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",1,0.3409669211,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys in a calendar year, including the use of results from multiple surveys and reporting of above-grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. The answer also mentions the availability of population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for calculating emissions from the surveyed equipment.",1056,,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,No answer found,No context found,"Equipment/component leaks are random in nature and minimal leaks in one year do not guarantee similar leak levels in the future.  There are no sunsetting provisions for individual emissions sources, only facilities.  EPA has provided provisions that allow facilities to stop reporting under certain conditions and with prior notification to EPA.  Please see 40 CFR 98.2(i) (1) – (i) (3).  EPA addressed sunset provisions in general in the proposal to the 2009 Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule (74 FR 16478).",,,1,"The answer is not found, therefore it is not possible to determine whether it is true or false without further information.",1,0.024691358,5,"The answer straightforwardly says that no answer was found, and makes no attempt to answer the question.",1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information or opinion related to the question asked.,15,,

We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question. The answer talks about a renowned painter and impressionist styles and techniques, which is not related to the field in which Marie Curie excelled.",1,"The monitoring plan described in the text does not specify equal monitoring percentages across all years in the cycle, which is not consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the provided monitoring plan would be consistent with the rule language without further information.",1,0.1978609626,4,"The answer does not provide a clear yes or no answer to the question and suggests that the monitoring plan described is not consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' However, the answer also includes additional information about the use of LaTeX equations and text to represent various conversion factors and parameters related to environmental regulations and emissions calculations, which is not directly relevant to the question being asked.",2,"The answer mostly lacks coherence. While the answer provides information about the provided input containing a mix of LaTeX equations and text, it does not directly address the question about the monitoring plan's consistency with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'",826,,

detection device and the infrared laser beam illuminated instrument. When using the acoustic leak detection device, a leak is detected if a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated. Additionally, acoustic stethoscope type devices can be used to identify non-leakers, with subsequent measurement required to calculate the rate if through-valve leakage is identified. The infrared laser beam illuminated instrument can be used for equipment leak detection, and any emissions detected by this instrument are considered a leak unless screened with Method 21 monitoring, where 10,000 ppm or greater is designated a leak.{

This is supported by the emission factors and component counts provided for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities in both Eastern and Western U.S. The data includes population emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves, which are relevant to the equipment in question. Additionally, the leaker emission factors for gas service components further confirm the applicability of 98.233(q) to the mentioned equipment. Therefore, based on the available data, it can be concluded that 98.233(q) applies to the specified production equipment.","Yes, 98.233(q), 'Leak detection and leaker emission factors,' applies to wellheads, separators at well site, storage tanks, and other equipment defined by 'production equipment'.{

The text analysis indicates that the volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas out of the AGR unit is not directly addressed. Additionally, the tables provided contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities related to petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting, as well as natural gas processing and storage. However, they do not explicitly specify the volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas out of the AGR unit. The equations and variables provided in the formula analysis are related to emissions calculations and factors for different gases, but they do not directly address the specific volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas.

However, the annual natural gas emissions, in standard cubic feet, from well venting for liquids unloading, and the annual N2O emissions are specified in § 98.233(f)(1) and § 98.233(l) respectively. The calculation of the quantity of CH4 recovered is also outlined in § 98.343(b).

Additionally, the answer acknowledges the provided tables as valuable data for assessing and managing emissions in the natural gas industry.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It is explicitly stated that acid gas removal units (AGRs) separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas using liquid or solid absorbents or membrane separators. The definition of acid gas includes hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) contaminants that are separated from sour natural gas by an acid gas removal unit. Therefore, acid gas removal units used only to sweeten a liquid stream, which involves separating hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas, meet the definition of acid gas removal units.",2,0.414893617,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the definition of acid gas removal units and how they relate to the separation of hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas. The answer also includes additional information about emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to natural gas production, gathering, and processing, as well as methane and hydrocarbon emission factors for different operational scenarios. The sentences flow well together and the answer is easy to understand, making it a perfect example of a coherent answer.",958,,
119,"If all of the emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside of the facility, does the facility still need to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then ""reduce"" the emission to zero?","If all of the CO2 emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside of the facility, the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero. This calculation involves considering various factors such as population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and specific emission factors for different components and services. The emission factors vary based on location, survey methods, and equipment types. Therefore, even with emissions being recovered and transferred outside the facility, the calculation and reduction of emissions to zero are still necessary to comply with regulations and environmental standards.","Yes, if all of the CO2 emissions from the AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero.{

This is a logical conclusion based on the information provided in the context.",2,0.3937823834,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the calculation and reduction of emissions to zero, considering various factors such as population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and specific emission factors for different components and services. The answer also acknowledges that the emission factors vary based on location, survey methods, and equipment types. However, the answer could have been more concise and structured to improve coherence.",721,,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"Yes, facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. The emissions for CO2 only (not CH4) vented directly to the atmosphere or emitted through a flare, engine, or sulfur recovery plant can be calculated using the methods described in paragraph (d) of the regulations. Additionally, the default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage are available for further reference and calculation of emissions.","Yes, facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.

",Reporters performing on-site injection of acid gas may not adjust emissions downward. §98.233(d)(11) clearly states that you may only adjust emissions estimates downwards for emissions recovered and transferred OUTSIDE the facility.  Please see EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-0582-31 in the Response To Comments (pages 1474 - 1476) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf.,,,5,The answer directly states that facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. It also provides additional information on how to calculate emissions for CO2 and refers to other available resources for further reference and calculation of emissions.,1,0.2816901408,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise response to the question and also provides additional information and resources for further reference and calculation of emissions.,766,,
121,For AGR vents is the use of a meter to measure flow rates required?,"Based on the provided information, the use of a meter to measure flow rates for AGR vents is not explicitly mentioned. However, the calculation methods described in the paragraph (d) can be used to calculate emissions for CO2 vented directly to the atmosphere or emitted through a flare, engine, or sulfur recovery plant. Therefore, the requirement for using a meter to measure flow rates for AGR vents is not specified in the given text. The tables provide emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to gas production and gathering facilities, but they do not explicitly address the requirement for using a meter to measure flow rates for AGR vents.","Based on the provided information, the use of a meter to measure flow rates for AGR vents is not explicitly mentioned.

This means that equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet are not subject to certain emission calculation requirements for blowdown vent stacks. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. The tables also include population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. These factors are essential for assessing and managing hydrocarbon emissions in the respective facilities and equipment.","The reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks pertains to the physical container volume.

The method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks allows the use of a flow meter to measure blowdown vent stack emissions for unique physical volumes greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. The annual CH4 and CO2 volumetric and mass emissions can be calculated by the meters according to the specified methods. Therefore, the use of average blowdown volumes is permissible for reporting in industry segments. Additionally, specific emission factors and component counts for major equipment in onshore petroleum, natural gas production, gathering, and boosting facilities are provided for both Eastern and Western U.S. regions. This data can be utilized to further refine emission calculations and reporting for industry segments within these regions.","Yes, average blowdown volumes may be used for industry segments where reporting of this emission source is required.

It explains that the EPA allows the use of best available monitoring methods (BAMM) for well-related measurement data in specific time periods and under certain conditions, and that BAMM can be used for parameters that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of the relevant subpart. It also mentions that specific deadlines exist for the use of BAMM, and after those deadlines, facilities must follow all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements. Finally, it notes that requests for extension of the use of BAMM can be submitted, subject to meeting approval criteria.

The answer also mentions the possibility of submitting requests for extension of the use of BAMM subject to meeting approval criteria. Additionally, the answer provides relevant information from the provided tables, which contain default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. This information is essential for understanding and implementing the best available monitoring methods for well-related measurement data.

127,Will EPA approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of compressor vents routed to flare?,"Based on the analysis, the EPA does approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for well-related measurement data in specific circumstances, but with time limitations and under certain criteria. However, the provided text and tables do not directly address the approval of Subpart W BAMM specifically for compressor vents routed to flare. The tables provide emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, storage, LNG, and distribution. These factors are important for understanding the environmental impact and regulatory compliance but do not directly confirm the approval of Subpart W BAMM for compressor vents routed to flare. Therefore, further specific information or documentation related to Subpart W BAMM for compressor vents routed to flare may be needed to confirm its approval by the EPA.","The EPA allows the use of best available monitoring methods for well-related measurement data for a limited period of time when it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate required monitoring equipment. The owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations specified in the relevant subpart during this period. However, starting from a specified date, the owner or operator must discontinue using the best available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements. Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods can be submitted under certain conditions. Therefore, the EPA does approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for well-related measurement data in specific circumstances, but with time limitations and under certain criteria.{

129,Do dehydrators which are used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator?,"Yes, dehydrators used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator as per the provided information. The definition includes devices that directly contact a natural gas stream to absorb water vapor, as well as devices that use desiccant to remove water from raw natural gas by adsorption or absorption. Therefore, dehydrators used to dry a liquid stream fall under the definition of dehydrator. Additionally, the table analysis provides data on emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, as well as equipment counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment. This information, while relevant to the oil and gas industry, does not impact the conclusion regarding the definition of dehydrators.","Yes, dehydrators which are used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator as per the provided information.

The rule specifies the use of Calculation Method 2 to calculate annual volumetric emissions using Equation W–5 for dehydrators with throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd. Additionally, the tables provide population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. The data also includes default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage. This information can be used to ensure compliance with emission requirements for different components and services in the specified regions.","The emission methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd in the preamble contradict the requirements in the rule. The rule specifies different calculation methods for dehydrator vents based on the daily natural gas throughput. For dehydrators with throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd, the rule requires the use of Calculation Method 2 to calculate annual volumetric emissions using Equation W–5. Therefore, the emission calculation method for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd is clearly defined in the rule.{
