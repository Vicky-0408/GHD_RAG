1,Who is required to report under subpart W?,"Facilities involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing are required to report under subpart W. This includes reporting the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary fuel combustion sources. Additionally, underground natural gas storage facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4B to this subpart.","Facilities are required to report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary fuel combustion sources under subpart W.

2,What GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities are covered under the rule?,"The gases that must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities include Carbon Dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. This encompasses all equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, gathering and boosting equipment, natural gas processing, natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment. Therefore, CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from these sources are covered under the rule. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering and boosting equipment. These factors and counts are essential for calculating and reporting the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O as required by the rule.","The gases that must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities include Carbon Dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

The applicability tool only serves as a guide to determine those facilities that are clearly well below the reporting threshold, those clearly above, and those close to the threshold who will need to collect further data to make a proper determination.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question. It states that the EPA will provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule. The tool will assist in reporting emissions from various source types and will include equations for conversion factors, molar volume conversion, and emission factors for fluorinated GHGs emitted from process vents. Additionally, the tool will provide default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and crude oil production equipment. It will also cover population emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and services. The answer is logically consistent with the information provided in the context.",2,0.2943722944,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is highly coherent and provides a comprehensive overview of the tool that EPA will provide to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule.

4,Do the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements?,"The facility definitions in this rule have a significant impact on other EPA reporting requirements. The rule stipulates reporting of SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level, including off-site electric power transmission or distribution locations. Additionally, N2O process emissions, total SF6 and PFC emissions, and GHG emissions from electric power systems are required to be reported. The reporting requirements also specify conditions for exemptions, changes in applicability, and facility mergers affecting reporting obligations. Furthermore, the rule outlines specific reporting thresholds for different industry segments and provides instructions for reporting excess emissions and facility cessation of operations. The provided tables contain data related to emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as population emission factors for natural gas transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage. The text also includes equations and explanations related to environmental factors and emissions calculations, but some statements lack context or specific details for complete interpretation.","Yes, the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements. The rule stipulates that facilities must report SF6 and PFC emissions at the facility level, including emissions from equipment installed at off-site electric power transmission or distribution locations. Additionally, the rule requires reporting of N2O process emissions, total SF6 and PFC emissions, and GHG emissions from electric power systems. The reporting requirements also specify conditions for exemptions, changes in applicability, and facility mergers affecting reporting obligations. Furthermore, the rule outlines specific reporting thresholds for different industry segments and provides instructions for reporting excess emissions and facility cessation of operations. Therefore, the facility definitions in this rule have a significant impact on other EPA reporting requirements.{

6,How is the petroleum and natural gas systems source category defined?,"The petroleum and natural gas systems source category is defined by the equipment and processes involved in the production, processing, and transportation of petroleum and natural gas, including specific segments such as natural gas processing, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas processing, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, offshore petroleum and natural gas production. This includes equipment used in the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas, such as gathering pipelines, compressors, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares. Additionally, it covers emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment, natural gas-driven pneumatic pumps, and more. The category also includes various emission factors and component counts for different equipment and materials used in the petroleum and natural gas systems, as well as population emission factors for different components and services related to onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage.","The petroleum and natural gas systems source category includes various segments such as natural gas processing, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas processing, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, offshore petroleum and natural gas production, and more. It involves equipment used in the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas. This includes gathering pipelines, compressors, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares. Natural gas processing involves the separation of natural gas liquids (NGLs) or non-methane gases from produced natural gas, and the separation of NGLs into component mixtures. The source category also covers emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment, natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, and more. Therefore, the petroleum and natural gas systems source category is defined by the equipment and processes involved in the production, processing, and transportation of petroleum and natural gas, including specific segments and associated emissions.{

}","Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year must report. The rule defines three different types of facilities. You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive list of facilities that must report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems), including onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, onshore natural gas processing facilities, underground natural gas storage facilities, onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities, LNG storage facilities, LNG import and export equipment, and natural gas distribution facilities. The answer also correctly explains that these facilities are required to report under subpart W due to their involvement in the production, processing, storage, and distribution of oil and natural gas, as well as their associated emission factors as specified in the provided tables. Therefore, the answer has perfect relevance and deserves a rating of five stars.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate list of the facilities that must report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems), which includes onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, onshore natural gas processing facilities, underground natural gas storage facilities, onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities, and LNG storage facilities. The answer also correctly states that these facilities are required to report under subpart W due to their involvement in the production, processing, storage, and distribution of oil and natural gas, as well as their associated emission factors as specified in the provided tables.

8,What gases must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities?,"Onshore petroleum and natural gas system facilities must report Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions. They are also required to report CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from gas flares, stationary and portable fuel combustion sources, and all other applicable stationary combustion sources. In addition, the emission factors for various components in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering systems are provided, including population emission factors, average component counts, and whole gas leaker emission factors for different survey methods.","Onshore petroleum and natural gas system facilities must report Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions.

}","Under this rule, facilities will detect, as applicable, and calculate GHG emissions according to the specified quantification methods. See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how greenhouse gas emissions are calculated for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities. It mentions that the emissions are calculated based on various factors such as equipment leak emissions, vented emissions, and fuel combustion sources, and that the calculation involves using appropriate default emission factors for different components and equipment types as listed in the relevant tables of subpart W. The answer also mentions that the facility must report the information specified in the paragraphs (r)(1)(i) through (v) of the section separately for each emission source type required to use Equation W–32A that is located at the facility.

13,The applicability tool for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas has an operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons. How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons is directly related to the volume of oil produced in barrels during the time periods in which associated gas was vented or flared. This correlation can be determined by considering the emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment. Additionally, the calculation of annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing is crucial for understanding the impact of the operating factor on the barrels of crude oil produced. The emission factors and component counts provide valuable insights into the environmental impact of associated gas venting and its relationship to crude oil production.","The operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons is directly related to the volume of oil produced in barrels during the time periods in which associated gas was vented or flared.

Hence, it is left to the facility to consider whether this is a significant source, including use of an acoustic detection device that has algorithms to quantify through-valve leakage from scrubber dump valves to determine applicability.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question, as it does not provide any information about whether the EPA offers guidance on estimating a worst-case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability.",5,"The provided text clearly states that there is no direct guidance on estimating a worst-case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability.

16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage is due to specific reporting requirements and emission factors for each type of facility. For example, underground natural gas storage facilities utilize default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service, while onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service. This difference is reflected in the specific emission factors and reporting requirements for each type of facility. Additionally, the emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves vary based on the region and the survey methods used, further contributing to the differences in units used for vented emissions.","In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting because each type of facility has specific requirements for reporting emissions. For example, underground natural gas storage facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service, while onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service. Therefore, the difference in units used for vented emissions is based on the specific emission factors and reporting requirements for each type of facility.{

19,"Is there a PowerPoint presentation available on the reporting rule signed by Administrator Jackson on November 8, 2010 for the petroleum and natural gas facilities?","Yes, there is a PowerPoint presentation available on the reporting rule signed by Administrator Jackson on November 8, 2010 for the petroleum and natural gas facilities. The content provides detailed information about the definition of facilities with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting, natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment. It also specifies the reporting requirements for different industry segments within the petroleum and natural gas production, including the emission thresholds for reporting, equipment types, and geographic location combinations. Additionally, it outlines the reporting requirements for natural gas processing facilities and the equipment/activities that must be reported. The presentation also includes tables with data on emission factors, component counts, designation of regions, leaker emission factors, and methane population emission factors for various equipment and facilities related to petroleum and natural gas production. Furthermore, it provides equations related to conversion factors and molecular weights. Therefore, the PowerPoint presentation on the reporting rule signed by Administrator Jackson on November 8, 2010 for the petroleum and natural gas facilities is available within the provided content, along with comprehensive data and equations for analysis and reference.","Yes, there is information available on the reporting rule signed by Administrator Jackson on November 8, 2010 for the petroleum and natural gas facilities.

22,Should self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W?,"Based on the information provided, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading are integral to the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting facilities. These facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment, which includes well drilling and completion equipment, workover equipment, natural gas dehydrators, compressors, generators, boilers, and heaters. Therefore, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts for major equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. support the inclusion of self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading for reporting GHG emissions. The default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors for onshore natural gas production and gathering further emphasize the significance of including self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading in reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W.","Based on the information provided, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading are integral to the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting facilities.

The context states that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading are integral to the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting facilities, and these facilities are required to report GHG emissions from various equipment, including workover equipment and heaters. Therefore, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W. The additional information provided about emission factors and component counts further supports the inclusion of these equipment for reporting GHG emissions.",2,0.1762114537,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any indication of uncertainty.,5,"The answer is highly coherent and provides a clear and comprehensive explanation. It not only states that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W, but also provides supporting evidence from the emission factors and component counts for major equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. Additionally, it mentions the default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors for onshore natural gas production and gathering, which further emphasize the significance of including self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading in reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W.",1166,,
23,How do I define a facility under subpart W? Are all industry segments included in one annual GHG report?,"Under subpart W, a facility is required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources following the methods outlined in § 98.233(z). It's important to note that not all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report. Additionally, specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting are provided for both Eastern and Western U.S. regions. The designation of states into Eastern and Western U.S. is also outlined for reference.","The facility must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources following the methods in § 98.233(z) under subpart W.

}","An onshore production facility is defined in 40 CFR 98.238 and will report only those emissions from the emissions sources listed in 40 CFR 98.232.  The onshore production facility has a single designated representative and does not include other industry segments or other source categories in its annual GHG report.  Similarly, if a facility meets the definition for natural gas distribution that facility reports only what’s listed in 98.232(i).  All other industry segments under subpart W use the definition of facility in subpart A and report emissions in a single annual GHG report.  Each facility must have one and only one designated representative.  But, the same DR could represent multiple facilities.  Other than onshore production and natural gas distribution, it is possible for a single facility to report under multiple industry segments.  Please see requirements in 98.231(a) and response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 in the EPA’s final Response to Public Comments Document for subpart W.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by stating that a facility under subpart W is required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources following the methods outlined in § 98.233(z).

24,What emissions are reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities?,"Petroleum and natural gas system facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. This reporting includes onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, natural gas processing, and onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities. The emissions data must be quality assured as applicable. The emission factors for different components and materials in the Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, including population emission factors, average component counts, whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for natural gas processing, and population emission factors for natural gas transmission compression. These factors are essential for accurately quantifying and reporting emissions from petroleum and natural gas system facilities.","Petroleum and natural gas system facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

26,Does the current GHGRP data include all U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems?,"The current GHGRP data includes emissions from various equipment and activities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These emissions encompass CO2, CH4, and N2O from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. Additionally, the data covers emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting, natural gas processing, natural gas transmission compression, and more. This is further supported by the table analysis, which provides default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing plants, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, and more. Therefore, it can be concluded that the current GHGRP data does include U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems.","The current GHGRP data includes emissions from various equipment and activities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing.

    ""result"": ""The provided input contains a mix of LaTeX equations, some of which are incomplete or unclear. However, based on the available information, it seems to cover a wide range of equations related to environmental emissions, such as emissions factors, stoichiometric ratios, and conversion factors. The equations appear to be related to various aspects of emissions calculations, including combustion efficiency, abatement utilization factors, and emissions from specific fuel types. The input also includes parameters such as inventory of gases, carbon content, and mass flow rates. However, due to the incomplete and unclear nature of some equations, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive analysis without additional context or clarification.""

27,What percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP?,"Emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP if emission sources specified in § 98.232 emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. The percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP depends on whether the specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The provided table data includes emission factors for various components and equipment related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and distribution. These factors can be used to calculate the actual emissions and assess whether they meet the reporting threshold specified under the GHGRP.","Emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP if emission sources specified in § 98.232 emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

}","EPA does not have an exact estimate of what percent of U.S. emissions are covered under petroleum and natural gas systems at this time.  The petroleum and natural gas systems source category (Subpart W) requires reporting from facilities above an emissions threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e.  It is difficult to quantify what net emissions occurr below the threshold.  In addition, facilities below the threshold may not be directly comparable to facilities over the emission threshold due to differences in the types of emission sources covered.  EPA will continue to analyze the emissions from reports as well as linking the information to the US GHG Inventory to identify what fraction of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are covered by the GHGRP.",4,"The answer provides a clear explanation of the conditions under which emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP, and mentions the importance of emission sources emitting 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The answer also mentions the types of emissions that offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report. Additionally, the answer mentions the availability of emission factors for various components and equipment related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and distribution, which can be used to calculate the actual emissions and assess whether they meet the reporting threshold specified under the GHGRP. However, the answer does not provide a specific percentage value for the emissions reported under the GHGRP, which is why it is rated 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",5,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question asked, stating that the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP depends on whether the specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

December 31, 2016, for certain parameters where it was not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate required monitoring equipment. However, the use of BAMM was not anticipated to be approved for estimating emissions beyond December 31, 2011, except for unique and extreme circumstances related to safety, technical infeasibility, or inconsistency with other regulations. Requests for extension of the use of BAMM beyond specified dates were subject to approval criteria and required demonstration of infeasibility to install monitoring equipment. Therefore, the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods had a limited and specific impact on emissions estimation within the defined timeframes.{

The answer accurately reflects this information.,3,0.1148648649,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation of the impact of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) on emissions estimation within defined timeframes. The answer also includes relevant population emission factors and leaker emission factors for different equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting. However, the answer could be further improved by organizing the information in a more structured and concise manner.",9982,,
32,How does the petroleum and natural gas systems data reported under the GHGRP compare to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB)?,"The GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas systems must be quality assured as specified in the regulations. Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities have specific monitoring and QA/QC requirements outlined in 30 CFR 250. Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, as well as natural gas processing plants, are required to report GHG emissions based on various parameters such as equipment type, production type, geographic location, and emission source types. The reporting includes details on CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. Additionally, the reporting requirements vary based on different industry segments and emission thresholds. The data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) must adhere to these specific reporting requirements and regulations set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under subpart W of 40 CFR 98. The comparison of the petroleum and natural gas systems data reported under the GHGRP and the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) involves detailed emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services in both onshore and offshore facilities. These factors and counts provide insights into the differences and similarities in reporting requirements and methodologies between the two systems.","The GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas systems must be quality assured as specified in the regulations.

33,"What are the notification requirements when an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin?","When an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin, the notification requirements involve reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions. Additionally, the facility must report the total annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to applicable onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks, in barrels. Furthermore, the facility needs to report the total annual oil/condensate throughput that is sent to all atmospheric tanks in the basin, in barrels. This reporting is essential to comply with the regulations under Subpart W. The emission factors and component counts provided in the tables offer specific data that can be utilized for calculating and reporting the emissions and oil throughput as per the notification requirements.","For an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility reporting under Subpart W, the notification requirements when selling wells and associated equipment in a basin involve reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions.

N2O analyzers to measure the amount of process N2O emissions. Additionally, you must determine the temperature and pressure in the biogas that is collected and routed to a destruction device at least once each calendar week. The temperature and pressure monitors must be operated, maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Furthermore, you must demonstrate that measurements at remote locations can reliably and accurately represent the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter under all expected ambient conditions. Finally, you should use the mathematical correlation derived from the demonstration to convert the remote temperature or total pressure readings to the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter on a daily basis, and then use these values to correct the measured flow rates to standard conditions.{

Additionally, the population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment are provided for both Eastern and Western U.S. These factors include emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also outlined. Furthermore, default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, leaker emission factors for natural gas processing plants, transmission compression, and underground gas storage are specified based on different survey methods. This comprehensive data can be utilized to estimate GHG emissions in the absence of a continuous gas composition analyzer.","When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available, annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b) to determine the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations.{

36,What are the requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare?,"To determine the volume of gas sent to a flare, there are several options based on the availability of continuous flow measurement devices. If a continuous flow measurement device is available on the flare, the measured flow volumes must be used to calculate the flare gas emissions. If all of the flare gas is not measured by the existing flow measurement device, the flow not measured can be estimated using engineering calculations based on best available data or company records. If there is no continuous flow measurement device on the flare, engineering calculations based on process knowledge, company records, and best available data can be used. Additionally, factors such as the volume of flare gas combusted during indexed start-up, shutdown, or malfunction events, the average higher heating value of the flare gas, and the calculation method of flare stacks as specified in the regulations should be considered. The provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services, which can be utilized in the engineering calculations to estimate the volume of gas sent to a flare.","To determine the volume of gas sent to a flare, you have several options based on the availability of continuous flow measurement devices.

39,How does this final rule relate to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program?,"The final rule specifies that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Additionally, the rule requires quality assurance of GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas emissions sources, and adherence to monitoring and QA/QC requirements as set forth in 30 CFR 250 for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. Therefore, the final rule directly relates to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program by setting emission reporting thresholds and quality assurance standards for natural gas distribution and production facilities. The provided tables contain detailed information on emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These tables provide valuable data for assessing and managing emissions in the natural gas industry, aligning with the objectives of the EPA's Natural Gas STAR program to reduce methane emissions and improve operational efficiency.","The final rule specifies that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

41,How do I determine applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources?,"To determine the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, you must ensure that the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3) and follow the specific reporting guidelines for the different types of stationary fuel combustion sources. Additionally, for facilities under onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and natural gas distribution, specific reporting requirements for stationary and portable combustion emissions apply. The emissions from stationary combustion sources, including boilers, process heaters, and other miscellaneous combustion sources, must be reported under subpart C of the regulations, following the requirements of subpart C, except for flares. Furthermore, the calculation of CH4 and CO2 volumetric emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting involves considerations such as the total number of natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, population emission factors, concentration of GHGi (CH4 or CO2), and the average estimated number of hours in the operating year the pumps were operational. These calculations can be completed using the provided equations and emission factors from the relevant tables based on the specific equipment and material types in use at the facility.","Subpart W of the environmental regulations requires the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources. This includes combustion units such as boilers, process heaters, and other miscellaneous combustion sources. Facilities under onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and natural gas distribution have specific reporting requirements for stationary and portable combustion emissions. The emissions from stationary combustion sources must be reported under subpart C of the regulations, following the requirements of subpart C, except for flares. Therefore, to determine applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, you must ensure that the facility meets the applicability requirements of either §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3) and follow the specific reporting guidelines for the different types of stationary fuel combustion sources.{

EF = Population emissions factors for natural gas driven pneumatic pumps (in standard cubic feet per hour per pump) listed in Table W-1A of this subpart for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. GHGi = Concentration of GHGi, CH4, or CO2, in produced natural gas as defined in paragraph (u)(2)(i) of this section. T = Average estimated number of hours in the operating year the pumps were operational using engineering estimates based on best available data. Default is 8,760 hours."",
        ""Equation_2"": ""To calculate CH4 and CO2 volumetric emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting, the following assumptions will be made to complete the calculation: 1) T will be the default value 86 hours. 2) The concentration of GHGi is 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2. EF for High Continuous Bleed Pneumatic Device Vents is 37.3 scf/hour/component. Your pneumatic device emissions would be 31,041,060 scf CH4 which is calculated as 100 * 37.3 scf / hr / device * 0.95 * 8760 hours and 326,748 scf CO2 which is calculated as 100 * 37.3 scf / hr / device * 0.01 * 8760 hours.""

45,"Does an offshore facility reported in the GOADS 2008 that did not exceed the combined emissions threshold for subparts C and W sources of more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e have to report GHG emissions for RY2011 if emissions exceed this threshold?","Based on the information from the GOADS 2008, offshore facilities that did not exceed the combined emissions threshold for subparts C and W sources of more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e are required to report GHG emissions for RY2011 if emissions exceed this threshold. This requirement is in accordance with the monitoring and reporting requirements specified in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 (GOADS) for both facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction and those not under BOEMRE jurisdiction. Additionally, the provided equations and emission factors from the tables offer valuable insights into the calculation and assessment of greenhouse gas emissions for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. The data on average component counts for major equipment and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. further contribute to understanding the regulatory and operational aspects of emissions management in the oil and gas industry.","Offshore facilities reported in the GOADS 2008 that did not exceed the combined emissions threshold for subparts C and W sources of more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e are required to report GHG emissions for RY2011 if emissions exceed this threshold.

}","Yes. The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, stating that the offshore facility would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011 based on the information provided in the result_text. The answer also provides additional information on the emissions levels from both subpart W and stationary combustion sources, and how they exceed the reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year. Furthermore, the answer mentions the availability of data on emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities in both the Eastern and Western U.S., which can be used for further analysis and assessment of the facility's emissions and reporting requirements.

The offshore facility emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources, which exceeds the threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year for reporting. Therefore, based on the emissions levels from both subpart W and stationary combustion sources, the facility is required to report GHG emissions for 2011.

47,"Can we use 2011 BOEMRE data, rather than the previously available data from 2008, for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility?","Yes, offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities can use the 2011 BOEMRE data for reporting RY2011 emissions. The data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 can be used to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types. Additionally, facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction should report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in the data collection and emissions estimation study published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. Therefore, based on the provided information, the 2011 BOEMRE data can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. In addition, the default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, methane emission factors, and equations for calculating fuel-specific CO2 emission factors and annual emissions from various sources are available to support the reporting process.","Yes, offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities can use the 2011 BOEMRE data for reporting RY2011 emissions.

Therefore, if an offshore oil and gas production platform or facility is farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, it must report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C. The provided table data contains emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as for crude oil production equipment. However, it does not directly address the reporting requirements for offshore facilities under Subpart C. Therefore, the reporting obligation for offshore facilities should be determined based on the specific regulatory guidelines and requirements outlined by the EPA for Subpart C.","Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for offshore petroleum and natural gas production from all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304.

49,By when do onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report?,"Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W are required to report CO2 emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions, CH4 emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions, and N2O emissions from gas flares. The reporting must include information specified in paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of the section for each major equipment type, production type, and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C. Additionally, facilities must report the information specified in paragraphs (r)(1)(i) through (v) separately for each emission source type required to use Equation W–32A that is located at the facility. This reporting requirement encompasses specific emission factors for components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps, as well as average component counts for major equipment types in different geographic locations. The emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment types, including leaker emission factors, are also part of the reporting requirements. The geographic designation of Eastern and Western U.S. is relevant for reporting purposes. Furthermore, specific emission factors for different survey methods and components are provided for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as for natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage. The emission factors for LNG storage and methane population emission factors are also included in the reporting requirements.","Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report CO2 emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions, CH4 emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions, and N2O emissions from gas flares.

Since published GOADS data are not available, should they be using the GOADS methodologies to calculate the emissions?","Offshore facilities subject to GOADS should report annual emissions using the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE as referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 250.304. However, since published GOADS data are not available, they should not be using the GOADS methodologies to calculate the emissions. Instead, they can refer to the default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, as well as the default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment to calculate the emissions. Additionally, specific emission factors for different components and services are available for both the Eastern and Western U.S., which can be used for accurate reporting.","Offshore facilities that are subject to GOADS should report annual emissions using the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE as referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 250.304.

The total annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks must also be reported. If the average daily throughput of oil is greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, then Calculation Method 1 or 2 should be used. If the throughput is less than 10 barrels per day, Calculation Method 3 is applicable. Therefore, the determination of daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks should be based on the Calculation Method specified in the regulations. Additionally, the provided tables contain default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. These factors and counts are essential for calculating the emissions and determining the daily oil throughput for compliance with the specified threshold.","To determine the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks and compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1), you must calculate the annual CH4 and CO2 emissions from onshore production storage tanks using the specified Calculation Methods 1, 2, or 3 as outlined in paragraph (j) of this section.

These equations provide the means to calculate flowback rates for well completions and well workovers. The flowback rates calculated using these equations are converted from actual conditions to standard conditions using Equation W-33. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and locations related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting. However, the table data does not directly relate to the standard versus actual conditions of Equations W-11A and W-11B.","Equations W-11A and W-11B provide the means to calculate flowback rates for well completions and well workovers.

}","When the GHGRP requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production were proposed, EPA’s goal was to provide a facility definition that all producers could directly apply, and that would be both practical and cost-effective.  EPA sought public comment on a range of possible options for defining the facility that would report with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, ranging from defining the facility at the individual well pad, to defining the facility at the field-level, to defining the facility at the basin-level.  Taking into account public comment, EPA finalized the definition of facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production using a basin-level approach because the operational boundaries and basin demarcations are clearly defined and are widely known, and the approach covered most emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",5,"The answer accurately explains that the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to ensure comprehensive monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The answer also provides details on what the reporting encompasses and the goal of the requirement. Therefore, the answer has perfect relevance to the question.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. It states that the goal is to capture emissions from various sources and ensure accurate reporting of GHG emissions from all relevant equipment types and geographic locations, which allows for a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of GHG emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. This information is directly supported by the provided context.",3,0.179916318,,,5,"The answer is well-written and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a comprehensive explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin, including the equipment and activities involved in the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas, as well as associated storage or measurement vessels. The answer also explains how reporting by basin allows for a more accurate assessment of GHG emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.",3824,,
63,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","If a facility does not have a Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) value for a well, there are several options available to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring. One option is to elect to use one of the procedures specified in the regulations to determine GOR if it cannot be determined from available data. Another option is to use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category if GOR from each well is not available. Additionally, facilities can calculate the gas to oil ratio (GOR) of the hydrocarbon production from oil well(s) tested and determine the production rate from gas well(s) tested. These options provide flexibility for facilities to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring in the absence of specific GOR values for individual wells. In addition, there are default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage, methane leaker emission factors for LNG import and export equipment, methane population emission factors for LNG import and export equipment, and methane emission factors for natural gas distribution available for reference and calculation to support the determination of GOR for associated gas venting and flaring.","If a facility does not have a Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) value for a well, there are several options available to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring.

65,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my oil well operations to decide whether I need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, you can calculate the average gas to oil ratio for the well(s) tested, in cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil using Equation W–12C of § 98.233. If GOR from each well is not available, you can use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category. It is necessary to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing that have a GOR of 300 scf/STB or greater. Therefore, determining the GOR is crucial for deciding whether emissions need to be reported. Based on the provided information, yes, you need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing if the GOR is 300 scf/STB or greater.","To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, you can calculate the average gas to oil ratio for the well(s) tested, in cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil.

The facility should also report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the requirements of subpart C (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). Additionally, the facility should consider the default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and the designated regions (Eastern and Western U.S.) for relevant data. The leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors for various components and services should also be taken into account for accurate reporting.","For RY2016, the gathering and boosting facility that previously reported under Subpart C should report the quantity of gas received by the facility in the calendar year, in thousand standard cubic feet.

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure should be calculated. This can be determined for each well with associated vented or flared natural gas. If individual well GOR data is not available, it can be determined from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category. Additionally, if the fuel is received as a blend or if components are mixed on site without precise measurement, a reasonable estimate of the relative proportions of the components must be made using the best available information. Furthermore, specific emission factors and component counts for gathering pipelines in different regions, such as the Eastern and Western U.S., are available to aid in the accurate determination of GOR based on the material type and equipment used in the gathering and boosting facilities.","The gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines can be determined by calculating the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. The GOR can be determined for each well whose associated natural gas is vented or flared, and if GOR from each well is not available, it can be determined from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category. Additionally, if the fuel is received as a blend or if the components are mixed on site without precisely measuring the mass or volume of each one individually, a reasonable estimate of the relative proportions of the components of the blend must be made using the best available information.

}",It is EPA’s intention for the purpose of Subpart W to follow general industry parlance whereby “fractionate” and “fractionation” refers to the separation of NGLs into individual chemical species or commercial products.,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate definition of 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in 98.230(a)(3), which involves separating natural gas liquids into individual component products such as ethane, propane, butanes, and pentane-plus (C5+). The answer also mentions the use of NGL fractionators and measurement for NGLs at custody transfer meters or meters used to determine the NGL product slate delivered from the fractionation facility. Additionally, the answer correctly states that if a NGL fractionator supplies a product that is a mixture or blend of two or more products, they are required to report the quantities of the constituents of the mixtures or blends separately. The answer is highly relevant to the given question and context, and provides all the important aspects required for a complete answer.",5,"The provided answer accurately defines 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in 98.230(a)(3) as the process of separating natural gas liquids (NGLs) into their individual component products such as ethane, propane, butanes, and pentane-plus (C5+), and provides additional information about NGL fractionators and reporting requirements for mixtures or blends of NGL products. The answer is logically consistent with the information contained in the context.",3,0.0259179266,,,5,The answer is well-written and all the sentences fit together naturally.

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the specified sources as outlined in the regulations. The GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas and facility-specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems is used to determine emissions. This means that the reporting of vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing is based on the GHG mole fraction in the feed natural gas and the facility-specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems. Additionally, specific emission factors for different components and regions are available, such as valve, connector, open-ended line, pressure relief valve, and pneumatic device vents, which contribute to the overall emissions from onshore natural gas processing. These factors vary based on the region, with different values for the Eastern and Western U.S. Furthermore, the average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering equipment are provided for the Eastern and Western U.S. Lastly, the total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, including leaker emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components in gas service, are also available for reference.","Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the specified sources as outlined in the regulations.

",EPA has reviewed your question and is unable to respond at this time.  Your question relates to an issue or issues currently the subject of ongoing litigation.  Please monitor the website for any additional guidance that may be available in the future. http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/reporters/subpart/w.html,,,5,"The answer directly and accurately states that facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are not subject to subpart W, which is supported by the information provided in the context.",2,0.1111111111,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-written and all sentences fit together naturally. It directly answers the question and provides additional information about the provided tables and default emission factors, while also acknowledging that they do not directly address the specific subpart W regulations for facilities solely designed for natural gas liquid fractionation.",483,,
78,How should I calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids?,"To calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, you should consider the annual average throughput. Specifically, processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the industry segment and must report. Therefore, if the onshore natural gas processing plant has an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater, it should be included in the reporting for environmental regulations. Additionally, the provided emission factors and component counts for major equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. can be used to assess the environmental impact and calculate the total hydrocarbon emissions for reporting purposes. The emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves are available to estimate the total hydrocarbon emissions. Furthermore, the population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, including low continuous bleed pneumatic device vents, high continuous bleed pneumatic device vents, and intermittent bleed pneumatic device vents, can be utilized for assessment and reporting purposes.","To calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, you should consider the annual average throughput.

}","The Rule states in §98.230(a) that the onshore natural gas processing industry includes all plants that fractionate, as well as all plants that do not fractionate that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.  Only those non-fractionating facilities with an annual average throughput of less than 25 MMscf per day would not be subject to reporting under subpart W even if the reporting threshold is triggered in Subpart C.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how to calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids.

79,What is the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often must a facility re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold?,"The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is that onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in this industry segment. The facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold annually based on the cumulative quantity of all NGLs received at the gas processing plant in the calendar year, in barrels. Therefore, the facility needs to assess its average throughput on an annual basis to determine if it falls below the 25 MMscfd threshold. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and various gas service components, which can be used for emissions calculations and compliance assessments related to the gas processing facilities.","The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is that onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in this industry segment.

The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often a facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold.

The facility must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in Table W–2 to this subpart. Additionally, the facility must include owned or operated residue gas compression equipment. The determination of applicability also involves considering the equipment components subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a of this chapter. Therefore, both the CO2e threshold and the throughput are crucial factors in determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility.

The answer also provides additional information from the table analysis, including specific emission factor data and average component counts, to support the inclusion of dehydrators in the source category. Overall, the answer is highly relevant and addresses all important aspects of the question.",5,"The answer provides clear and specific evidence from the context, including the statement that 'the dehydrator is considered part of the onshore natural gas processing facilities and must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the specified sources.' The table analysis and average component counts also confirm the inclusion of dehydrators in the emission calculations for onshore natural gas processing. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",5,0.09375,,,5,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the inclusion of dehydrators in the onshore natural gas processing source category.

83,"Under subpart W, are we required to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane?","Yes, under subpart W, natural gas processing facilities are required to include owned or operated residue gas compression equipment, which encompasses compressors used for refrigeration. The definition of natural gas processing includes the separation of natural gas liquids (NGLs) or non-methane gases from produced natural gas, and the separation of NGLs into component mixtures. This segment also includes all residue gas compression equipment owned or operated by the natural gas processing plant. Therefore, the requirement to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane falls under the scope of subpart W regulations. Additionally, the provided table data includes emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These factors can be utilized to calculate the potential GHG emissions from the compressors at the natural gas processing facility, considering the specific operational parameters and geographic location.","Yes, under subpart W, natural gas processing facilities are required to include owned or operated residue gas compression equipment, which encompasses compressors used for refrigeration.

84,"Under Subpart W of Part 98, the definition of Natural Gas Processing provides an unclear explanation of fractionation, additionally, fractionation is not defined within the rule.","The definition of Natural Gas Processing is clear and includes the separation of natural gas liquids (NGLs) or non-methane gases from produced natural gas, and the separation of NGLs into component mixtures. This encompasses forced extraction of natural gas liquids, sulfur and carbon dioxide removal, fractionation of NGLs, and the capture of CO2 separated from natural gas streams. Additionally, the segment includes all residue gas compression equipment owned or operated by the natural gas processing plant. The rule specifies that natural gas processing plants that separate NGLs from natural gas and produce bulk or y-grade NGLs but do not fractionate these NGLs into their constituent products are included. Therefore, the rule does provide a clear explanation of fractionation within the context of natural gas processing, and the definition of fractionation is covered within the rule. The table data provides emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and leaker emission factors for various components in different survey methods and scenarios. It also includes population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression and leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage. The data in the tables complements the definition of natural gas processing by providing specific emission factors and component counts relevant to the industry.","The definition of Natural Gas Processing includes the separation of natural gas liquids (NGLs) or non-methane gases from produced natural gas, and the separation of NGLs into component mixtures.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,No answer found,No context found,"The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question and provides no information related to the methods for monitoring tank emissions or the treatment of intermittent emissions from storage tanks.,1,"The answer is not found, therefore it is not possible to determine whether it is true or false without further information.",1,0.0,5,"The answer straightforwardly states that no answer was found, and makes no attempt to answer the question.",1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the given question.,15,,

Additionally, if the storage tank receiving the separator oil is sent to a flare and if scrubber dump valve leakage occurred for a transmission storage tank vent stack and the vent stack vented to a flare during the calendar year, then specific information must be reported. Therefore, it is possible for the storage tank to be sent to a flare, and if certain conditions are met, reporting to the relevant authorities is required. The emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and various gas services in the Eastern and Western U.S. are also provided.

The answer provided agrees with this information.,4,0.1891891892,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise response to the question, while also providing additional information on the emission factors and population emission factors related to various components and equipment in the natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission processes. The answer also mentions that the tables provide information on the average component counts for major equipment and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. locations.

89,How does a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability?,"To determine the subpart applicability for a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator, the key factors to consider are the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the equipment and activities specified in the relevant paragraphs of the regulation. Additionally, the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in Table W–3A to this subpart is required for onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities. The determination of subpart applicability involves assessing the emissions and utilizing the specified emission factors as per the regulations. The emission factors provided in the tables include population emission factors, average component counts, whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors, which are essential for evaluating the emissions and determining the subpart applicability.","To determine subpart applicability for a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator, the key factors to consider are the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the equipment and activities specified in the relevant paragraphs of the regulation.

The sentences fit together well and sound natural as a whole.,2583,,
91,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"Yes, unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases are subject to reporting. The text analysis confirms that the intentional or designed releases of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas are to be reported, including process designed flow to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes, equipment blowdown for maintenance, and direct venting of gas used to power equipment. Additionally, the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources related to natural gas production and distribution facilities is specified. This is further supported by the table analysis, which provides detailed population emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. The emission factors for leaker components, compressor components, and other equipment used in natural gas transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage further emphasize the need for reporting unintentional natural gas releases. Therefore, based on the integrated analysis, it is evident that unintentional natural gas releases are indeed subject to reporting as per the provided information.","Yes, unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases are subject to reporting.

underground storage reservoir, the following factors need to be considered: 1. The facility must report CO2 and methane emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions. 2. The facility must use appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service. 3. The facility must indicate whether any equipment components are subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards. 4. The facility must report the quantities specified for underground natural gas storage facilities. Based on the provided information, the emissions from separate facilities injecting or withdrawing gas from the same underground storage reservoir can be reported by considering the specific emission factors and standards applicable to underground natural gas storage facilities.{

93,Could EPA clarify that the natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W?,"The natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W. This is supported by the default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, which provide emission factors for storage stations and wellheads, but do not include high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations. Additionally, the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. does not categorize high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations as underground natural gas storage facilities.","The natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W.{

94,"What is the definition of ""facility"" for underground storage?","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage of natural gas is comprehensive and includes various components and emission reporting requirements. It encompasses subsurface storage in depleted gas or oil reservoirs, salt dome caverns, and all the wellheads connected to the compression units located at the facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs. The facility also includes processes such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, while excluding transmission pipelines. Additionally, the facility must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific sources and use appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service. The facility definition covers a wide range of equipment and emission factors, and it applies to both Eastern and Western U.S. states. Furthermore, it involves various equations for conversion factors and emission calculations, as well as population emission factors for different components and services related to onshore natural gas transmission compression and processing plants.","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage of natural gas includes subsurface storage in depleted gas or oil reservoirs, salt dome caverns, and all the wellheads connected to the compression units located at the facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs.

The regulations clearly specify reporting requirements for underground natural gas storage facilities, including the equipment/activities to be reported, the emission factors to be used, and the specific sources of emissions such as CO2, CH4, and N2O. Therefore, both operators should individually report the relevant emissions from their respective operations.",2,0.2331288344,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any uncertainty.,4,The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise response to the question. It explains that both operators should submit separate emission reports and provides a reason for it. It also mentions the regulations and emission factors that can be used to calculate and report emissions accurately.,915,,
96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"Natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components because the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are designed to encompass all relevant components and activities within the storage facilities. These emission factors, based on default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service, take into account specific sources and processes involved in underground natural gas storage, including compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. Therefore, separate emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components are not needed, as the existing factors cover all the necessary components and activities within the storage facilities.","The reason natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment is because the emission factors for underground natural gas storage facilities are based on default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4A and Table W–4B to this subpart. These emission factors take into account the specific sources and processes involved in underground natural gas storage, including compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. Therefore, the emission factors are designed to encompass all relevant components and activities within the storage facilities, eliminating the need for separate emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components.{

97,Does Subpart W require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility or does reporting start only when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage?,"Yes, Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility. The reporting includes CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the underground natural gas storage facilities. Additionally, appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service are utilized for reporting. Therefore, reporting starts from the salt dome mining process and continues throughout the operation of the underground natural gas storage facility. The provided tables contain detailed population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for various equipment and components related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as underground natural gas storage. The tables provide specific emission factors for different survey methods and components, which are essential for accurate reporting of emissions.","Yes, Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility.

It also correctly mentions that the reporting requirements are specified in subpart C of this part and that emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided in the tables, which can be used to calculate and report the emissions as required. The answer is logically consistent with the information provided in the context.",1,0.2602739726,2,The answer attempts to answer the question but conveys a little uncertainty by using words like 'should' and 'as per the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part'.,4,The answer is mostly coherent and provides relevant information about reporting requirements for a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recovery and storage. The answer also mentions the availability of emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. to calculate and report the emissions as required.,691,,
100,Are dehydration units that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility?,"Yes, dehydration units that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility. The text analysis specifies that underground natural gas storage encompasses processes like compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, excluding transmission pipelines. This is further supported by the table analysis, which provides data on the component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, including dehydrators. Additionally, the table on default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage further confirms the inclusion of dehydrators within the scope of underground natural gas storage facility.","Yes, dehydration units that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility.

A pressure relief valve is a special type of valve and falls in the category of ""other,"" so this emission source is included in the leak detection survey and required to be reported.  Regarding your first question: sections 98.232(g) and 98.232(h) do no include venting from LNG storage tanks as an emission source; therefore venting emissions from LNG storage tank are not required for LNG storage or for LNG import and export equipment.  However, if the LNG storge tank is blown down to atmosphere, then section 98.232(h) does require reporting.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, stating that emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals must be calculated and reported, and providing additional details on the regulations and default emission factors provided for various components and services in the petroleum and natural gas industry.",5,"The context clearly states that emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals must be calculated and reported, along with the use of appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components.

Additionally, the answer mentions the calculation methods for annual natural gas emissions and the reporting requirements for various equipment and venting scenarios, and provides relevant table data including default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, methane leaker emission factors, and methane population emission factors for various components and services in the petroleum and natural gas industry.

105,"At LNG Storage sites, how should pumps that are internal and submerged be treated?","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated by reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions. Additionally, appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components in LNG service or gas service should be used, and the quantities specified in the applicable paragraphs of the regulation should be reported. Therefore, pumps that are internal and submerged at LNG storage sites are subject to specific reporting requirements for emissions and leak factors. The default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, provide population emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps. These emission factors vary based on the region and the type of service (gas, light crude, heavy crude). Additionally, the default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment provide insights into the number of valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves for different equipment types and regions. The default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities offer emission factors for components like valves, flanges, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pump seals, and others, based on different survey methods. Furthermore, the default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression facilities provide leaker emission factors for various components based on different survey methods. The default methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage specify emission factors for the vapor recovery compressor. Additionally, the default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components and import/export equipment offer emission factors for components like valves, pump seals, connectors, and others, based on different survey methods. Therefore, the treatment of internal and submerged pumps at LNG storage sites involves utilizing these default emission factors and reporting the relevant quantities as per the regulations.","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated by reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions.

109,Are natural gas distribution facilities required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulator(s) under §98.232(i )?,"Based on the provided information, natural gas distribution facilities are not required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulators under §98.232(i). The requirement for reporting emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment is only applicable if emission sources specified in §98.232(i) emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Therefore, residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulators are not mandated for reporting under §98.232(i). Additionally, the equations and tables provided offer detailed information on emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and services related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and storage. However, the equation labeled 'Equation_1' lacks context for precise interpretation, and it appears to be part of a larger expression involving symbols such as \gamma, \Omega, \mathbf{r}, and \mathbb{Q'. The other equations provide definitions and units for variables related to fuel combustion and CO2 emission factors. The tables offer population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and component counts for different equipment and services, providing valuable data for emissions management and compliance in the natural gas industry.","Natural gas distribution facilities are not required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulators under §98.232(i).

The answer also correctly states that facilities must indicate the number of years in the leak survey cycle if performing equipment leak surveys across a multiple year cycle, not exceeding a five year period. Additionally, the answer provides relevant information about the provided tables containing emission factors and component counts for different equipment and materials used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and crude oil production equipment, which can be used to calculate emissions and determine the frequency and scope of leak detection surveys required for compliance.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the number of leak detection surveys that must be conducted in a calendar year, as well as the requirement to use the results from each survey for emissions calculation. The answer also correctly states that facilities must indicate the number of years in the leak survey cycle if conducting surveys across multiple years. The additional information provided about the tables containing emission factors and component counts is relevant and helpful, but not necessary for answering the question.",2,0.3471882641,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys in a calendar year and the reporting requirements for facilities. It also mentions the availability of tables containing emission factors and component counts for different equipment and materials used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and crude oil production equipment, which can be used to calculate emissions and determine the frequency and scope of leak detection surveys required for compliance.",1120,,

We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question, as it provides information about Marie Curie being a painter rather than excelling in a specific field.",1,"The answer clearly states that the monitoring plan mentioned in the question does not align with the requirement of being approximately equal across all years in the cycle. Therefore, the monitoring plan is not consistent with the rule language. The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",4,0.2967032967,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,2,"The answer mostly lacks coherence. While the answer does provide a clear and direct response to the question, it also includes additional information that is not directly related to the coherence of the monitoring plan. The answer could be improved by focusing solely on the coherence of the monitoring plan and providing more specific details or examples to support the evaluation.",676,,

a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program already in place, with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm, can be used to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q)(1)(iv). The components listed in §98.232(c)(21), (e)(8), (f)(6), (f)(7), (f)(8), (g)(6), (g)(7), (h)(7), (h)(8), and (j)(10) that are subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in §60.5397a(b) must be surveyed using any of the leak detection methods in §98.234(a)(6) or (7) and emissions must be calculated using the procedures specified in paragraph (q)(2) of §98.233. Additionally, the phrase 'the collection of fugitive emissions components at well sites and compressor stations' in §60.5397a(b) means 'the collection of components for which you elect to comply with §98.233(q)(1)(iv).' Therefore, the existing state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program can be utilized for estimating fugitive greenhouse gas emissions as per the specified regulations.{

However, the answer does not provide any additional data or analysis related to the CO2 content specifically, which would be required for a more complete and relevant answer.",1,"The answer explicitly states that it is not possible to determine whether the volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas out of the AGR unit is zero without further analysis or specific data. Therefore, the answer cannot be logically true or false based on the provided information.",3,0.2405063291,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,4,The answer is mostly coherent as it provides information on the methods specified in paragraphs (d)(8)(i) through (d)(8)(iii) of section 98.233 to determine the annual average volumetric fraction of CO2 content in natural gas flowing out of the AGR unit. It also acknowledges that further analysis or specific data is needed to make a definitive determination and provides additional information on emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. that may be relevant to the determination of CO2 content in natural gas from the AGR unit.,861,,
118,Do acid gas removal units which are used only to sweeten a liquid stream meet the definition of acid gas removal units?,"Yes, acid gas removal units (AGRs) used only to sweeten a liquid stream meet the definition of acid gas removal units. This is because they are designed to separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas using liquid or solid absorbents or membrane separators. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting. However, the table data does not directly relate to the definition of acid gas removal units and therefore does not impact the conclusion regarding the definition of AGRs.","Yes, acid gas removal units (AGRs) used only to sweeten a liquid stream meet the definition of acid gas removal units as they are designed to separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas using liquid or solid absorbents or membrane separators, as per the provided information.{

The answer also provides additional information on the calculation process and factors that need to be considered for accurately assessing and reducing the emissions to zero as required by the regulations.",1,0.314893617,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. The answer provides information on how to calculate emissions and reduce them to zero, but also acknowledges that it is a complex process involving various factors.",4,The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise explanation of the steps required to calculate and reduce emissions from an AGR unit. It also mentions the essential factors that need to be considered for accurate assessment and reduction of emissions.,1012,,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"Yes, facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. If any CO2 emissions from the acid gas removal unit were recovered and transferred outside the facility, the annual quantity of CO2 in metric tons that was recovered and transferred outside the facility must be reported under subpart PP of this part. Additionally, the provided tables contain default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and other relevant emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage. These factors can be used for estimating emissions and reporting as required.","Yes, facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.

}","The units of measure for emissions calculated in Equation W-3 are in cubic feet per year. However, §98.233(d)(10) requires that the volumetric emissions of equation W-3 be converted into mass emissions using §98.233(v)’s methods.  You must report emissions in metric tons of CO2e to meet the reporting requirements in §98.236(c)(3)(v).  If reporters use the methodology set forth in §98.233(d)(2), then a vent flow meter must be used to determine the total annual volume of vent gas flowing out of the AGR unit.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question.

123,For blowdown vent stacks does the 98.233.i reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume refer to a gas volume or a physical container volume?,"The reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks pertains to the physical container volume. Equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section. This determination is supported by the analysis of the relevant regulations and standards, as well as the provided tables containing emission factors and component counts for various equipment in different regions of the U.S. The tables provide specific emission factors for different components, survey methods, and equipment types, but they do not directly address the specific volume threshold mentioned in the question. Therefore, the conclusion is primarily based on the text analysis of the regulations and standards.","The reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks pertains to the physical container volume.

125,Will EPA approve the use of BAMM relating to the measurement of isolation valves at compressors in the shut down depressurized mode that are to be measured at least once every three calendar years?,"{'answer': 'The EPA requires the measurement of volumetric emissions from isolation valve leakage for compressors in not-operating-depressurized-mode at least once in any three consecutive calendar years, provided the measurement can be taken during a scheduled shutdown. If three consecutive calendar years occur without measuring the compressor in not-operating-depressurized-mode, the measurement must be taken at the next scheduled depressurized shutdown. Therefore, EPA approves the use of BAMM (Best Available Monitoring Methods) for the measurement of isolation valves at compressors in the shut down depressurized mode that are to be measured at least once every three calendar years. Additionally, various emission factors and population emission factors for different components and regions are provided for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as for underground natural gas storage and LNG storage. Furthermore, conversion equations for lb/dscf-ppm N2O, molar volume, molecular weights, and unit conversions are also available.'}","Based on the provided information, the EPA requires the measurement of volumetric emissions from isolation valve leakage for compressors in not-operating-depressurized-mode at least once in any three consecutive calendar years, provided the measurement can be taken during a scheduled shutdown.

126,Will EPA approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of individual compressor vents routed a common manifold?,"Yes, EPA will approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold. The regulations allow for the measurement of combined volumetric emissions from manifolded groups of compressor sources by conducting measurements at the common vent stack, with specific frequency requirements outlined in the regulations. Additionally, there are methods for performing as found measurements and continuous measurements for both centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources within a manifolded group. The regulations also provide specific calculation methodologies for determining annual volumetric GHG emissions associated with manifolded groups of compressor sources. Therefore, based on the provided regulations, the use of Subpart W BAMM for the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold is approved by the EPA. In addition, the tables provide detailed emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services, which can be used for compliance and monitoring purposes.","Yes, EPA will approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold.

127,Will EPA approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of compressor vents routed to flare?,"Yes, EPA will approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for the measurement of compressor vents routed to flare. The detailed requirements for calculating and reporting emissions from centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources routed to a flare, including the measurement methods, frequency, and reporting obligations, support the approval. Additionally, the specific parameters outlined for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from compressor sources routed to flares align with the approval of Subpart W BAMM for this purpose. The provided table data further supplements the approval by offering default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. The emission factors for leakers, compressor components, non-compressor components, and population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage also contribute to the overall understanding and support for EPA's approval of Subpart W BAMM for this specific purpose.","Yes, EPA will approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of compressor vents routed to flare. The result_text provides detailed requirements for calculating and reporting emissions from centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources routed to a flare, including the measurement methods, frequency, and reporting obligations.

Is this throughput specific to vent throughput or dehydrator throughput?","Based on the analysis, the throughput of 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day specified in §98.233(e)(1) is specific to the dehydrator vent throughput. Therefore, emissions must be calculated from dehydrator vents with a throughput greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day. This conclusion is supported by the specific component counts for dehydrators in both Eastern and Western U.S., as well as the population emission factors for various components related to gas service, natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage.","The throughput of 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day specified in §98.233(e)(1) is specific to the dehydrator vent throughput.

","Under §98.232(e), emissions from flare stacks are not required to be reported as a separate emission source for onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities.  However, this does not exclude the reporting of flared emissions from the other emission sources listed in §98.232(e) if they are routed to a flare.  The flare source type in §98.233(n) covers only emissions that are not reported in association with any of the other source types in §98.233; see §98.233(n)(10).  For example, if transmission storage tank emissions are going to a flare, then the rule requires the adjustment of transmission storage tank emissions sent to flare per §98.233(k)(4).  The flared transmission storage tank emissions, however, have to be reported as transmission storage tank emissions under §98.236(c)(9).",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the correct guiding action for emissions from flares, as well as additional information on the methodology and tables provided in section 98.233.

136,Does a simple open pipe with no flare tip count as a flare under 98.233 (n ) in Subpart W?,"Based on the provided information, a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not count as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W. The emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering equipment indicate that open-ended lines have emission factors, but there is no specific mention of a simple open pipe with no flare tip being classified as a flare. Additionally, the average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering do not explicitly categorize a simple open pipe with no flare tip as a flare. Therefore, based on the available data, such a pipe would not be considered a flare under the specified regulations.","Based on the provided information, a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not count as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W.{

The answer provides additional supporting evidence from the emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering equipment, as well as the average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering.
