For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",5,"The answer provides a detailed and accurate explanation of how greenhouse gas emissions are calculated for subpart W facilities, including the specific GHGs to be considered, the calculation methodologies to be used, and the reporting requirements.

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"In the context provided, the vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing facilities are reported as part of the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) report. The emissions to be reported include CO2, CH4, N2O, and each fluorinated GHG. The reporting is required for facilities with annual emissions exceeding certain thresholds, such as 25,000 metric tons of CO2e per year or more. The reporting requirements are detailed in 40 CFR part 98, and the specific methodology for calculating emissions is outlined, including the use of Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Additionally, the reporting includes emissions from blowdown vent stack, fuel combustion units, and sorbent. The reporting also encompasses the separation and measurement of biogenic CO2 emissions from non-biogenic CO2 emissions. The reporting of emissions is to be done by March 31, 2012, and the specific reporting requirements are outlined for different types of fuel combusted and process equipment used in natural gas processing.

Use the appropriate factor in Table W–1A of th ","What constitutes a facility, how to determine the reporting threshold, and reporting of emissions from collocated and dual purpose equipment is as follows: 1) As a first step the reporter must determine the emissions from all equipment listed in 98.232(c) for onshore petroleum and production.  Per section 98.231(a) only sources listed in 98.232(c) need to be considered for threshold determination for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. 98.238 defines “facility” for the purposes of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems.  Per the requirements of 98.3 each “facility” must submit a GHG report for all source categories at that “facility”.  2) Note that while identifying onshore production emissions sources reporters have to determine whether the source is “on the well pad or associated with a well pad”.  The location of production wells within other facilities is inconsequential to this determination.  Sources on a well pad or associated with a well pad across the entire reporting basin have to be taken into consideration.  If your emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production are equal to or greater than 25,000mtCO2e, then onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities report as a separate facility and include all emissions sources listed in 98.232(c).  3) Except for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution, which have unique facility definitions, all other segments subject to subpart W are considered in the threshold determination for a single facility.  You would also include emissions from other source categories at your facility (e.g., stationary combustion).  If there are emissions sources that are dual purpose then the rule requires this piece of equipment to be reported under the majority use industry segment based on guidance provided in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (pp. 1606-1608).  4) For collocated industry segments, which cannot occur in the case of onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution due to the requirements in 98.231(a), EPA has provided guidance on emissions reporting in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14.  Based on the information provided, the facility cannot be reported as onshore production and natural gas processing combined (see point 1 above).  For all the other segments, the report should use guidance in points 2-3 above to determine the segment under which the facility should be categorized.",3,"The answer provides relevant information about the reporting requirements and definitions related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage, but it does not directly address the specific scenario of a facility combining onshore petroleum and natural gas production with natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for enhanced oil recovery and storage.",1,"The provided answer does not address the specific scenario of a facility combining onshore petroleum and natural gas production with natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for enhanced oil recovery and storage.

","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information about GHG Monitoring Plans, including the required elements, references to existing corporate documents, procedures for quality assurance, and the use of monitoring methods. However, the answer does not provide a clear answer to the specific question about whether a monitoring plan that results in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4 and 20% in year five, would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'",1,"The answer correctly states that there is a requirement for the number of transmission-distribution transfer stations to be approximately equal across all years in the cycle. However, the answer also correctly states that there are no specific numbers mentioned in the text to calculate the percentage of stations being monitored in each year. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the monitoring plan described would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'",1,0.2920110193,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the answer does not provide specific numbers to calculate the percentage of stations being monitored in each year, it acknowledges the requirement for the number of transmission-distribution transfer stations to be approximately equal across all years in the cycle and provides information about GHG Monitoring Plans.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information about GHG Monitoring Plans and the requirement for the number of transmission-distribution transfer stations to be approximately equal across all years in the cycle.
