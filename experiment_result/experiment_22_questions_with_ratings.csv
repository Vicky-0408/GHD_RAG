The fractionation involves using measurement for NGLs at custody transfer meters or other meters used to determine the NGL product slate delivered from the fractionation facility. Additionally, if a NGL fractionator supplies a product that is a mixture or blend of two or more products listed in Tables NN–1 and NN–2 of the subpart, the NGL fractionator is required to report the quantities of the constituents of the mixtures or blends separately.","The definition of 'fractionate' in 98.230(a)(3) is the process of separating a mixture of natural gas liquids (NGLs) into their individual component products, such as ethane, propane, butanes, and pentane-plus (C5 +).

The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",5,"The answer provides a complete and accurate response to both aspects of the question, including the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold and the frequency of re-evaluation.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions differ in the sense that 98.233(k) allows flexibility in monitoring CH4 from different points, while 98.234(a)(1) specifies annual monitoring of tank vapor vent stack emissions. Intermittent emissions from the storage tank can be treated by estimating emissions through monitoring changes in container weights and inventories, or by monitoring the mass flow of the pure cover gas or carrier gas into the gas distribution system. An alternative method to quantify the emissions can be the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) to quantify CO2 mass emissions, and following the Tier 4 Calculation Method for calculating CO2 emissions if a CEMS has both a CO2 concentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor. Additionally, the emissions of each fluorinated GHG in metric tons per year for equipment pieces must be calculated and summed annually, including types of equipment excluded from monitoring.","For CH4 liberated at degasification systems, operators are allowed flexibility to monitor CH4 from each well and gob gas vent hole, from a centralized monitoring point, or from a combination of the two options. They must address emissions from all points and document the methodology for calculating total emissions. The tank vapor vent stack must be monitored annually for emissions using the methods specified. Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify CO2 mass emissions. If a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) has both a CO2 concentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor, CO2 emissions must be calculated following the Tier 4 Calculation Method. The calculation and reporting of CH4 and N2O emissions is not required as part of the Tier 4 requirements for AGR units. Storage tank vented emissions can be estimated by monitoring the changes in container weights and inventories, or by monitoring the mass flow of the pure cover gas or carrier gas into the gas distribution system. The installed CEMS include a gas monitor or a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, and the monitors must be certified. For ongoing quality assurance, operators are required to follow the applicable procedures for monitoring and QA/QC requirements. The emissions of each fluorinated GHG in metric tons per year for equipment pieces must be calculated and summed annually, including types of equipment excluded from monitoring.","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",4,"The answer addresses the main aspects of the question by explaining the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, how to treat intermittent emissions from the storage tank, and alternative methods to quantify the emissions.

89,How does a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability?,"In the context of subpart applicability for a natural gas compressor station, the emergency generator would not be considered.

110,Please explain how many leak detection surveys must be conducted a calendar year?  Must a facility indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year?,"At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year. If multiple complete leak detection surveys are conducted in a calendar year, the results from each complete survey must be used when calculating emissions using Equation W–30. Natural gas distribution facilities performing equipment leak surveys across a multiple year leak survey cycle must report the number of years in the cycle. If a facility chooses to use the multiple year option, the number of transmission-distribution transfer stations that are monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle. Therefore, a facility must indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year, and if they choose to conduct multiple surveys, the results from each survey must be used for emissions calculation.","At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year.
