}","Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year must report. The rule defines three different types of facilities. You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate description of who must report under subpart W, including the specific information that must be reported and the methodology used to calculate emissions. The answer also mentions the definition of Owner and Operator used in subpart A, and provides additional details on the reporting requirements for facilities in Eastern and Western U.S. The answer addresses all important aspects of the question and is highly relevant to the context.",5,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question, stating that onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must report the information specified in paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, for each major equipment type, production type (i.e., natural gas or crude oil), and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C to this subpart for which equipment leak emissions are calculated using the methodology in § 98.233(r). The terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, as defined in § 98.238 of this part. Facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part must report the information specified in paragraphs (r)(1)(i) through (v) separately by component type, service type, and geographic location (i.e., Eastern U.S. or Western U.S.).

Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors.

11,When does reporting for subpart W begin?,"The provided text explains that reporting for subpart W begins immediately for facilities that are currently subject to this subpart, and for facilities that become newly subject to this subpart. For the first 6 months of required data collection, facilities that acquire new sources from another facility that were not previously subject to this subpart may use best engineering estimates for any data related to those newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart. Additionally, the provided tables contain information on default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission compression, underground storage, and LNG storage. These tables provide specific emission factors for different components and services, which can be used for calculating emissions as per the reporting requirements of subpart W.","The reporting for subpart W begins immediately for facilities that are currently subject to this subpart, and for facilities that become newly subject to this subpart.

For 2012 only, the GHG report must be submitted to EPA by September 28, 2012. This reporting deadline applies to all subparts being reported by the facility. If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",,,5,"The provided answer accurately states that reporting for subpart W begins immediately for facilities that are currently subject to this subpart, and for facilities that become newly subject to this subpart. The answer also correctly mentions that facilities that acquire new sources from another facility that were not previously subject to this subpart may use best engineering estimates for any data related to those newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart. Additionally, the answer provides information on default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission compression, underground storage, and LNG storage, which is relevant to the reporting requirements of subpart W.",1,0.2466666667,1,"The answer provides a clear and complete explanation of when reporting for subpart W begins, without any uncertainty or lack of knowledge.",4,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of when reporting for subpart W begins, and also mentions the use of best engineering estimates for newly acquired sources. The answer also mentions the availability of default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission compression, underground storage, and LNG storage.

16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The document provides default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage. The emission factors are provided for different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meters/instruments, and others. These emission factors are used to calculate the vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting. The reason for the difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage is due to the different survey methods and emission factors used for each type of facility. The emission factors for each component vary based on the survey method used, and this variation leads to differences in the units used for vented emissions between the two types of facilities.","The content mentions the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for different types of facilities, including underground natural gas storage and onshore natural gas transmission compression. It also discusses the calculation of CH4 and CO2 annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage for transmission storage tanks. The document provides information on the calculation methods and reporting requirements for various equipment leaks and emissions from different components associated with storage stations. However, it does not explicitly explain the specific reason for the difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage.{

","If the power take-off for operating the truck mounted workover rig is the truck wheel drive engine (i.e. a transmission option to transfer the truck wheel drive shaft to powering the rig generator or wench or other rig equipment) then yes, this workover rig arrangement is “self propelled.” and not required to be reported.  However, if the truck has a separate engine not connected to the drive wheels that powers the workover rig equipment, then it is “non-self propelled” and must be included in your report.",,,5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It is mentioned that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading are integral to the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting facilities. These facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment that cannot move on roadways under its own power and drive train. Additionally, specific equations and methods for calculating emissions from various sources, including well venting for liquids unloading and workovers that flared gas, are mentioned. Therefore, based on the provided information, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W.",2,0.2134831461,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear explanation of the information provided in the context and how it relates to the question.

Are all industry segments included in one annual GHG report?,"The document provides detailed information about the reporting requirements and methods for facilities under subpart W. It mentions that facilities subject to subpart W may use best engineering estimates for data related to newly acquired sources for the first 6 months of required data collection. It also specifies the use of default emission factors for different types of facilities and the reporting of emissions from various sources such as electricity generating units, industrial wastewater treatment, underground natural gas storage facilities, and others. The document outlines the conditions under which facilities must report under subpart W and the applicability of different subparts based on the type of facility and its emissions. It emphasizes the importance of following the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting as specified in each relevant subpart of this part. Additionally, the document includes several tables providing default emission factors and average component counts for different types of equipment in various regions, as well as population emission factors for specific services. These tables can be used to calculate emissions for reporting purposes.","The document provides detailed information about the reporting requirements and methods for facilities under subpart W.

It outlines the calculation methods and emission factors to be used for different equipment types and industry segments. Additionally, the document includes several tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment. These tables provide specific emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps. The emission factors are categorized based on different industry segments and geographical locations, such as Eastern U.S. and Western U.S. The tables also include population emission factors for different equipment and material types. However, the document does not explicitly mention the total emissions reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities. Instead, it focuses on providing the factors and methods for calculating emissions from individual components and equipment. Therefore, the specific emissions data for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.","The document provides detailed information about the definition of facilities for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting, as well as the reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions.

January 1, 2010 to March 31, 2010, and from January 1, 2015 to March 31, 2015. Requests for extension of the use of BAMM were also mentioned, with specific criteria and approval criteria provided. The document also outlined the process for discontinuing the use of BAMM and transitioning to following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements. The EPA did not anticipate approving the use of BAMM to estimate emissions beyond December 31, 2011, except for unique and extreme circumstances. The text also mentioned the calculation methodologies and equations to be used for estimating GHG emissions. However, specific quantitative data on the effect of BAMM on emissions was not provided.{

         ","In order to provide Petroleum and Natural Gas System facilities with time to adjust to the requirements of the GHGRP, EPA made available the optional use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for unique or unusual circumstances.  Where a facility used BAMM, it was required to follow emission calculations specified by the EPA, but was allowed to use alternative methods for determining inputs to calculate emissions.  These inputs are the values used by reporters to calculate equation outputs or results.  Examples of BAMM include monitoring methods used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W), supplier data, engineering calculations, and other company records.  It is not immediately apparent how the use of BAMM affected emissions, because facilities used BAMM in different ways and for different parameters depending on their unique or unusual circumstances.",,,,,1,0.0710900474,,,,,8497,,
32,How does the petroleum and natural gas systems data reported under the GHGRP compare to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB)?,"The document outlines the requirements for reporting GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems, including the need to report CO2 emissions from the complete combustion or oxidation of petroleum products and natural gas liquids. It specifies the conditions under which facilities must report emissions, such as when emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Additionally, it details the calculation methods and quality assurance procedures that must be followed, including the maintenance of laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used in the measurement of density and carbon share for petroleum products and natural gas liquids. The document also provides specific instructions for reporting emissions from different types of facilities, such as onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and natural gas distribution facilities. It further emphasizes the importance of accurate measurement and reporting of emissions, including the use of flow or volume measurement systems that correct to standard conditions. The provided tables contain detailed emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution. These tables provide specific emission factors for different components and equipment, as well as different survey methods, such as Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). The emission factors are expressed in standard cubic feet per hour per component and vary based on the type of equipment, survey method, and service area (e.g., gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service). The tables also include population emission factors for different types of facilities, such as onshore natural gas transmission compression and distribution services. These population emission factors are also expressed in standard cubic feet per hour per component and provide insight into the emissions from various equipment and components in different service areas. Overall, the document provides comprehensive guidance on the reporting requirements and methods for GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems, which can be compared to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for further analysis.","The document outlines the requirements for reporting GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems, including the need to report CO2 emissions from the complete combustion or oxidation of petroleum products and natural gas liquids.

However, it does not explicitly detail how the 'calculation utility' excel spreadsheet accounts for 'Population Count and Emission Factors' when providing the user with a final CO2e number.{

45,"Does an offshore facility reported in the GOADS 2008 that did not exceed the combined emissions threshold for subparts C and W sources of more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e have to report GHG emissions for RY2011 if emissions exceed this threshold?","The document mentioned that offshore facilities must adhere to monitoring and QA/QC requirements as set forth in 30 CFR 250.

The equation describes E = COUNT * EF, where COUNT is the number of units and EF is the emission factor. The given offshore facility emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources based on GOADS calculation methodology and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources. Since the threshold for reporting emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources is 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year, the facility would not be required to report GHG emissions during 2011.","Based on the information provided, an offshore facility that emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources based on GOADS calculation methodology and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would not be required to report GHG emissions during 2011, as the threshold for reporting emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources is 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year.{

The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",,,5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. The given offshore facility emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources based on GOADS calculation methodology and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources. Since the threshold for reporting emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources is 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year, the facility would not be required to report GHG emissions during 2011.",2,0.3622641509,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation of the calculation methods and emission factors used to derive the emissions from the given data. It also directly answers the question by stating that the facility would not be required to report GHG emissions during 2011 due to the threshold for reporting emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources being 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year.",618,,

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is essential to use the most recent BOEMRE data, as referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 250.304, for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility. The document also provides detailed equations and explanations for calculating emissions, including the mass or volume of fuel combusted per year, default high heat value of the fuel, fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor, and annual natural gas usage. Additionally, it includes tables with population emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as default average component counts for major equipment. These tables and equations can be used to calculate and report RY2011 emissions from offshore facilities.","The document provides detailed requirements for reporting emissions from onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.

However, it does provide detailed information about the reporting requirements for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as onshore facilities. It specifies the types of emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) that must be reported and the regulations (30 CFR 250.302 through 304) that govern the data collection and emissions estimation. Additionally, the document includes tables with default emission factors and component counts for different types of equipment and services, which can be used in emissions estimation and reporting. While it does not directly address the specific question about the distance of the facility from the limit of state waters, the provided information can be valuable for understanding the overall reporting requirements and methodologies for emissions data in the petroleum and natural gas production industry.","Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions as per the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. Offshore platforms do not need to report portable emissions. Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must also report specific information as specified in the regulations.

How do you calculate emissions from leaking components if onshore petroleum and natural gas source are not required to monitor components?,"The document provides information on how to calculate equipment leak emissions for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. It mentions the use of emissions factors listed in Table W-1A for different components and services. The emissions from equipment leaks are calculated using Equation W–30 and the requirements specified in paragraphs (q)(2)(i) through (xi) of this section. For components not subject to fugitive emissions standards, the emissions can be calculated using leak detection methods described in § 98.234(a)(6) or (7) and the procedures in paragraph (q)(2) of this section. Additionally, the document also refers to the use of default whole gas leaker emission factors for components in gas service, light crude service, and heavy crude service listed in Table W–1E, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in Table W–2 to Table W–7 of this subpart for different types of facilities. The emission factors are provided in standard cubic feet per hour per component for different regions and material types. The document also specifies different survey methods and their corresponding leaker emission factors for gas service components. Furthermore, it includes population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression. The provided tables contain detailed emission factors for various components and services, which can be used to calculate emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources.","The emissions factors listed in Table W-1A are used for calculating equipment leak emissions for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities.

Additionally, it includes tables with population emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as leaker emission factors for various survey methods. The tables also provide default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, as well as default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground storage, and LNG storage.

It also mentions the option to delay reporting of data elements for onshore production if certain conditions are met, and the requirement to report specific information by specified dates. The document also outlines the calculation methods for different scenarios based on the average daily throughput of oil, and provides guidance on estimating the number of atmospheric tanks, reporting the minimum and maximum concentration of CH4 and CO2, and reporting the number of atmospheric tanks that controlled emissions with flares. Additionally, it specifies the reporting requirements for different industry segments such as onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and onshore natural gas transmission pipeline.{

61,Are geologic provinces 160 and 160A one basin or separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"Geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered one basin for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. This is based on the specification that all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad in a single hydrocarbon basin is considered one facility. Therefore, if a person or entity owns or operates more than one well in a basin, then all onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment associated with all wells in the basin would be considered one facility.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to accurately track and regulate emissions from these facilities. This reporting is essential for monitoring and controlling the release of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific source types. Facilities are mandated to report if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The reporting also includes detailed information on equipment types, production types, and geographic locations. The requirement to report by basin allows for a more granular understanding of emissions, which facilitates targeted regulatory measures. Additionally, the text outlines specific calculation methods and default emission factors to be used for estimation, providing a standardized approach for reporting emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The provided tables contain default emission factors and average component counts for major equipment, which are crucial for accurate estimation and reporting of emissions.","The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to accurately track and regulate emissions from these facilities.

It mentions that reporting is essential for monitoring and controlling the release of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific source types, and that facilities are mandated to report if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The answer also highlights the importance of reporting detailed information on equipment types, production types, and geographic locations, and how the requirement to report by basin allows for a more granular understanding of emissions, which facilitates targeted regulatory measures. Additionally, the answer mentions the specific calculation methods and default emission factors provided in the text, which are crucial for accurate estimation and reporting of emissions. The provided tables contain default emission factors and average component counts for major equipment, which are also mentioned in the answer.",3,0.2996254682,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,,,1082,,
63,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","Facilities can determine the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) for associated gas venting and flaring by using the gas to oil ratio for the well in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil (GORp) as specified in Equation W–12C of § 98.233. If GOR from each well is not available, they can use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category. Additionally, they can use Calculation Method 1 as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section to determine the value of FRMs and FRI for gas wells, and Calculation Method 1 for liquids unloading in § 98.233(f)(1) to calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading. The document does not provide specific equations or extraction for analysis. However, it does mention the use of Calculation Method 1 to determine the value of FRMs and FRI for gas wells, and Calculation Method 1 for liquids unloading to calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading.","Facilities can determine the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) for associated gas venting and flaring by using the gas to oil ratio for the well in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil (GORp) as specified in Equation W–12C of § 98.233.

If GOR is still not available, then an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization or industry standard practice (as described in 40 CFR 98.234(b)) may be used.",,,5,"The answer provides accurate information on how facilities can determine the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) for associated gas venting and flaring by using the gas to oil ratio for the well in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil (GORp) as specified in Equation W–12C of § 98.233. It also mentions the use of Calculation Method 1 to determine the value of FRMs and FRI for gas wells, and Calculation Method 1 for liquids unloading to calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading, which are valid options for facilities if GOR from each well is not available or if they want to calculate emissions from well venting for liquids unloading.

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"The document provides comprehensive information on determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines and well production. It mentions that gathering pipelines with a GOR less than 300 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel (scf/STB) are not included in the industry segment. It outlines methods for determining GOR from well production oil and gas compositions and provides alternative procedures for determining GOR when data is not available. Additionally, it discusses the calculation of CO2 emissions from oil or other fluid streams separated from the fluid and the determination of the average GOR of all wells in an oil sub-basin. The document also includes calculation methodologies for estimating CO2 emissions from NGL fractionators and LDCs, as well as the determination of the average gas to oil ratio for well(s) tested. The provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, which can be used in the calculation of GOR and emissions. However, no specific formulas or equations for calculating GOR are mentioned in the provided text.","The document provides information about onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, including the definition of gathering and boosting equipment, the calculation methodology for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks, and the determination of the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for well production.

}","The gathering and boosting system owner or operator can use a direct measurement of GOR through either onsite measurement or by sending samples out for laboratory analysis. The timing and duration of the sampling/measurement program should follow existing regulatory requirements, which include standard methods published by a consensus-based standards organization or industry standard practices. See 40 CFR 98.234(b). The EPA realizes that owners or operators may calculate GOR for other reasons such as documenting fluid quality for financial transactions, equipment optimization or other state/federal reporting requirements. These values can be used where appropriate.A825. 40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W does not prescribe a specific approach to calculate GOR. Gathering and boosting system operators may use the best approach for their facility, including direct measurement, calculation from other measured data, and standard estimation measures. We note that within the EPA’s 2016 updates to New Source Performance Standards for the oil and natural gas sector, GOR is defined as the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to a standard temperature and pressure.

}",It is EPA’s intention for the purpose of Subpart W to follow general industry parlance whereby “fractionate” and “fractionation” refers to the separation of NGLs into individual chemical species or commercial products.,4,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the terms 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in the context of natural gas liquids (NGLs), including the process of separating NGLs into individual component products and the requirements for NGL fractionators to measure and report quantities of constituents. However, the answer also mentions equations and tables related to emissions factors, population emission factors, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, which are not directly related to the definition of 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in 98.230(a)(3).",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the terms 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in the context of natural gas liquids (NGLs), including the process of separating NGLs into individual component products and the requirements for NGL fractionators to use measurement and report quantities.

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported as part of the overall emissions reporting for the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. The emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from vented emissions and flare emissions are calculated and reported based on the equipment and activities specified in the relevant paragraphs of the regulations. The emission factors for different components and materials in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities are provided in the tables. These emission factors can be used to calculate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from vented emissions. Additionally, the default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment are also provided in the tables, which can be used in conjunction with the emission factors to estimate the total emissions. The document does not explicitly mention the specific location where vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported, but it provides the necessary data and factors for calculating and reporting these emissions.","Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported as part of the overall emissions reporting for the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities.

Although the document does not explicitly mention the specific location where vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported, the answer provides the necessary information to infer that these emissions are reported as part of the overall emissions reporting for the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities.",3,0.2259414226,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides relevant information about the reporting of vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing. It also mentions the emission factors and average component counts provided in the tables that can be used to calculate and report these emissions. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific location where vent emissions are reported.",1229,,
73,"In 98.230(a)(3), is 25 mmscf per day the design capacity for a processing plant or the actual capacity?","The document mentioned several calculation methods and tables related to emission factors and component counts for different equipment in natural gas production and processing facilities. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific design capacity of a processing plant in relation to the actual or design capacity of 25 mmscf per day as mentioned in 98.230(a)(3). The provided equations and tables are focused on emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and processes in the natural gas industry. Therefore, the document does not directly address the specific question about the design capacity of a processing plant in relation to the mentioned capacity of 25 mmscf per day.","The document provides detailed information on the determination of design capacity for landfills, calculation of annual manufacturing capacity, nameplate capacity, and various production capacities for different processes. It also outlines methods for determining actual gas consumption, working capacity, and process activity measurements. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific design capacity of a processing plant in relation to the actual or design capacity of 25 mmscf per day as mentioned in 98.230(a)(3).{

This is because the underground natural gas storage includes compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, and all the wellheads connected to the compression units located at the facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs. Therefore, the shared compression allows them to be considered as one combined facility for reporting purposes.","Based on the information provided, a natural gas processing plant and an underground natural gas storage facility can report as one combined facility if they share compression.

78,How should I calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids?,"The document provides information on the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids and have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. Additionally, it mentions the calculation of GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities. However, there are no specific equations or formulas provided for the calculation of the reporting threshold. The document also includes tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities, as well as leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression. These tables can be used to calculate emissions from specific components and equipment, which may be relevant to determining compliance with reporting thresholds.","The reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.

}","The Rule states in §98.230(a) that the onshore natural gas processing industry includes all plants that fractionate, as well as all plants that do not fractionate that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.  Only those non-fractionating facilities with an annual average throughput of less than 25 MMscf per day would not be subject to reporting under subpart W even if the reporting threshold is triggered in Subpart C.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.",3,"The answer partially addresses the main aspects of the question by providing information on the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids and mentioning the calculation of GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities.

79,What is the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often must a facility re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold?,"The 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is based on the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. Facilities must re-evaluate whether they fall below this threshold annually. The document does not provide specific equations or calculations related to this threshold, but it does contain tables with emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment in gas processing facilities. These tables can be used to calculate emissions based on the throughput and component counts, which may be relevant for evaluating compliance with the threshold.","The 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is based on the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.

The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by stating that the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is based on the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater, and that facilities must re-evaluate whether they fall below this threshold annually. The answer also acknowledges that the document contains tables with emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment in gas processing facilities, which may be relevant for evaluating compliance with the threshold.",4,0.2702702703,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold and how often facilities must re-evaluate whether they fall below it. The answer also mentions the availability of tables with emission factors and population emission factors that can be used to calculate emissions based on throughput and component counts, which shows a good understanding of the topic.",622,,

The first threshold is the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year emission threshold under § 98.2(a)(2), and the second threshold is the throughput of 25 MMscf per day under § 98.230(a)(3). The document also provides various tables containing default emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for different equipment and services related to natural gas processing facilities. These tables can be used to calculate the emissions from the facilities and determine their applicability for reporting GHG emissions. However, the document does not explicitly state which threshold takes precedence over the other. Therefore, it is essential to consider both thresholds and their respective calculations to determine the applicability of Subpart W for a natural gas processing facility.","The 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year emission threshold in § 98.2(a)(2) is used to determine the applicability of reporting GHG emissions for facilities. Additionally, the throughput of 25 MMscf per day is used to determine the applicability of reporting for onshore natural gas processing facilities.{

}","98.232 (d) states that “for onshore natural gas processing, report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the following sources”.  For example, if the compressor stream is 100% propane then the emissions will not include CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions and therefore will not have to be reported under subpart W.  However, if the facility exceeds the 25,000 mtCO2e threshold then the owner or operator must report combustion emissions for this compressor under subpart C.",2,"The answer does not address the main aspect of the question, which is whether we are required to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane. Instead, the answer provides information about the requirements for reporting equipment and activities for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression facilities under subpart W, as well as details about the types of compressors, their emissions, and venting. While this information may be useful for calculating emissions, it does not directly answer the question.",1,"The answer states that there is no specific mention of the requirement to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane. Therefore, the answer is not entailed by the context.",3,0.2941176471,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear and concise summary of the information provided in the context. It correctly states that there is no specific mention of the requirement to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane. It also mentions the availability of default emission factors and average component counts that can be used to calculate emissions based on the specific equipment and activities at the facility. However, the answer could have been more coherent by organizing the information in a more structured manner.",755,,

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions involve using continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and calculating emissions based on the concentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor. The intermittent emission from the storage tank can be treated by monitoring the changes in container weights and inventories using specific equations. An alternative method to quantify the emissions may be used if it complies with the requirements specified in the regulations. Additionally, the document provides default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, and total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage. These factors and counts can be used in the equations and methods specified in the regulations to quantify emissions and monitor tank emissions effectively.","The methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions involve using continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and calculating emissions based on the concentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor.

                           ","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the methods for monitoring tank emissions, including the use of continuous emission monitoring systems and monitoring changes in container weights and inventories for intermittent emissions. The answer also correctly states that alternative methods may be used if they comply with regulations. Additionally, the answer mentions the various default factors and counts provided in the document that can be used to quantify emissions effectively. Therefore, the answer has perfect relevance to the given question and context.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, how intermittent emission from the storage tank can be treated, and whether an alternative method can be used to quantify the emissions. The answer also mentions additional information provided in the document, such as default emission factors and component counts, which can be used to monitor tank emissions effectively.",1,0.2422680412,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise explanation of the methods for monitoring tank emissions, how to treat intermittent emissions, and the possibility of using alternative methods.

It also indicates the need to report information for each transmission storage vent stack where scrubber dump valve leakage occurred and the vent stack vented directly to the atmosphere during the calendar year. The text refers to the calculation method of flare stacks to determine storage tank emissions sent to a flare.

91,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"The document provides detailed information about the reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources such as well venting, equipment leaks, and flaring. It outlines the conditions under which facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment. The document emphasizes the importance of reporting emissions from unintentional natural gas releases and provides specific calculation methods and reporting requirements for different emission sources. Additionally, the document includes several tables with default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and facilities, which can be used in the calculation of emissions. Therefore, unintentional natural gas releases, such as those resulting from accidental releases, are subject to reporting as per the information provided in the document.","The document provides detailed information about vented emissions of natural gas, including intentional or designed releases of CH4 or CO2. It also outlines reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources such as well venting, equipment leaks, and flaring. The document also specifies the conditions under which facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment. It mentions the calculation of annual natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading and the reporting of emissions from onshore natural gas transmission pipeline industry segment. Additionally, it discusses the reporting of emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. Overall, the document emphasizes the importance of reporting emissions from unintentional natural gas releases and provides specific calculation methods and reporting requirements for different emission sources.{

Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether separate emission reports are required without further information.",1,0.2307692308,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the document does not explicitly address the specific scenario of joint ownership and operation of underground storage wellheads by two companies, it provides information related to underground natural gas storage facilities and emission factors. The answer acknowledges this and provides some information on the tables and equations provided in the document.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the document does not explicitly address the specific scenario of joint ownership and operation of underground storage wellheads by two companies, and whether separate emission reports are required in such a case. However, it also provides information about the requirement for reporting information related to underground natural gas storage facilities, such as total storage capacity and emission factors, and mentions the tables and equations related to various calculations and emission factors for different components and equipment used in natural gas production and storage.",821,,
96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"The text provides detailed information about the emission factors for various components of different facilities, such as natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, and storage. It also includes default emission factors for different equipment components in various regions. However, it does not explicitly address why natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment. The absence of specific information on this topic suggests that the text does not provide a direct explanation for this discrepancy.","The text provides detailed information about underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and other related facilities. It mentions the annual volume of natural gas placed into storage, withdrawn from storage, and delivered to downstream pipelines. It also discusses the calculation methods for CH4 and CO2 emissions from storage tanks and the use of default emission factors for different equipment components. However, it does not explicitly address why natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.{

97,Does Subpart W require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility or does reporting start only when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage?,"Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility. Reporting starts from the underground natural gas storage processes and operations, including compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, and all the wellheads connected to the compression units located at the facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs. The document also mentions the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service, and the calculation methods for reporting GHG emissions from onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks. The provided equations and tables offer detailed information on emission factors, calculation methods, and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, which can be used to calculate and report emissions as required by Subpart W.","Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility.

It explains that the document provides detailed information about onshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas storage, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations using CO2 or natural gas injection. It also mentions that the document does not explicitly mention specific numbers related to the facility in question, but provides tables with population emission factors, default average component counts for major equipment, and default emission factors for various components, which can be used to calculate emissions based on the specific equipment and operations at the facility. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",1,0.3320895522,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides detailed information about onshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas storage, and enhanced oil recovery operations using CO2 or natural gas injection. It also mentions the reporting requirements for emissions from onshore production and gathering facilities, including the calculation of CH4, CO2, and N2O emissions from storage tanks using different calculation methods. Additionally, it provides information on LNG storage, offshore production, and natural gas processing. Although specific numbers related to the facility in question are not explicitly mentioned, the answer provides relevant information that can be used to calculate emissions based on the specific equipment and operations at the facility.",1490,,
100,Are dehydration units that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility?,"The text provides detailed information about underground natural gas storage, including the processes and operations involved such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. It also explains the equipment and methods used in dehydrators, including the calculation methods for annual mass emissions from glycol dehydrators. However, it does not explicitly state whether dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility. The provided tables include emission factors for various components and equipment used in natural gas production, gathering, and processing. These tables can be used to calculate the emissions from different equipment, including dehydrators, which can be helpful in determining the environmental impact of dehydration units used in underground natural gas storage facilities.","The content provides detailed information about underground natural gas storage, including the processes and operations involved such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement.

}","LNG facilities will not be surveying the valves, connectors, and other components that are in Gas Service under 98.233(q).  At an LNG facility, a compressor that recovers vapor, but is designed so that it does not have reportable emissions of methane-containing gas, such as a flooded screw compressor, or one with seals purged with pressurized nitrogen, will not be reported, in accordance with the rule and the EPA’s response in Response to Public Comments, EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1026-7 (see pp. 45-46 in http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part1.pdf).  Vapor recovery compressors use a population emission factor, hence there is no leak detection required.  Reporters have to count the number of vapor recovery compressors and use the population emission factor.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, including the specific equipment listed in Table W-5 and the corresponding emission factor. The answer also mentions the availability of emission factors for other components and survey methods, as well as the counts of different components for equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. Overall, the answer fully addresses the main aspects of the question and provides relevant and useful information.",5,The answer directly states that only the equipment listed in Table W-5 (Vapor Recovery Compressor) is required to be reported if it is found to be leaking as defined in the rule. The answer also provides additional information on emission factors for different components and equipment counts in the Eastern and Western U.S. that can be used in emission calculation.,3,0.3659574468,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise answer to the question, including relevant information about the emission factor for the Vapor Recovery Compressor and other components, as well as the specific counts of valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves for different equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. that can be used in the emission calculation.",916,,
102,Do I have to calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods for GHG emissions, including the need to use appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components. It also discussed the calculation of annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading using specific methods. Additionally, it provided tables with default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage, as well as population emission factors for various components in different regions. These tables can be used to calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals. The emission factors provided in the tables can be used in the equation E = COUNT * EF, where COUNT is the number of units and EF is the emission factor, to derive the emissions from the operational LNG storage tank venting.","The document provides detailed information about LNG storage, vented emissions, import and export equipment, calculation methods for GHG emissions, and equipment leaks. It mentions the need to use appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components and the calculation of annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading using specific methods. It also discusses the calculation of emissions from storage tanks and the reporting requirements for various equipment components. Overall, the document contains relevant information about calculating emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals.{

A pressure relief valve is a special type of valve and falls in the category of ""other,"" so this emission source is included in the leak detection survey and required to be reported.  Regarding your first question: sections 98.232(g) and 98.232(h) do no include venting from LNG storage tanks as an emission source; therefore venting emissions from LNG storage tank are not required for LNG storage or for LNG import and export equipment.  However, if the LNG storge tank is blown down to atmosphere, then section 98.232(h) does require reporting.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate summary of the document's information about calculating emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals. It mentions the need to use appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components, the calculation of annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading using specific methods, and the tables with default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage and population emission factors for various components in different regions. The answer also explains how to use the emission factors provided in the tables to calculate emissions from the operational LNG storage tank venting using the equation E = COUNT * EF. Therefore, the answer has perfect relevance to the question and context.",5,"The answer provides detailed information about the calculation methods for GHG emissions, including the need to use appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components. It also discusses the calculation of annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading using specific methods. Additionally, it mentions the tables with default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage and population emission factors for various components in different regions, which can be used to calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals. The answer also provides an equation to derive the emissions from the operational LNG storage tank venting using the emission factors provided in the tables. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",2,0.3442622951,1,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question, without any uncertainty or lack of knowledge.",4,"The answer provides relevant information about the calculation of emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals.

The answer also mentions that appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components in LNG service or gas service should be used, and the quantity of LNG added into storage and withdrawn from storage in a calendar year should be reported. The answer further explains that the emission factors for different components such as valves, pump seals, connectors, and open-ended lines are provided in the tables, which can be used to calculate the emissions from the LNG storage sites. Overall, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",2,0.0913705584,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear and coherent explanation of how pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated at LNG storage sites, including the regulations for equipment leaks in LNG service and the reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions.

Additionally, it offers default population emission factors for underground natural gas storage and methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. The provided tables contain emission factors for various components and survey methods, which can be used to calculate the emissions from LNG storage tanks.

The text mentions the need to report emissions from LNG storage facilities, including venting of residual fluorinated GHGs, calculation methods for volumetric GHG emissions, and specific requirements for LNG import and export equipment. It also provides calculation methods for various emissions, including CH4 and CO2, from different sources such as storage tanks, blowdown vent stacks, and well venting for liquids unloading.{

                ""title"": ""Default Methane Leaker Emission Factors for Liquef","For natural gas distribution, a facility, which is the collection of all distribution pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by an LDC, is required to do at least one facility wide leak detection survey per calendar year and has the option to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys; if the facility selects this option, the additional facility-wide survey(s) must be completed during the same calendar year in order to account for fixing one or more leaks in the annual GHG report.  If the facility chooses to fix one or more leaks and conduct another survey to determine that the component is not leaking, it must conduct a facility wide leak detection survey in order to account for fixing the leak(s) in the annual GHG report.  As leaks are random in nature and while some leaks are fixed others are likely to occur.  Therefore, a comprehensive survey is the only statistically relevant manner by which to establish facility-wide leak emissions rates and account for leaks repaired.  Please see the response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1014-9 (Response to Comments, pp. 1281-1282, http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf) for further details.  It is very important to note that the requirement to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys should a company wish to account for fixing a leak does not preclude in any way a company from repairing a leak.  If a company chooses to conduct only one facility-wide leak detection survey in a calendar year but finds a leak during the survey, the company can and is encouraged to fix the leak.  The leak detected though, as noted above, must be reported as a leaker for the entire calendar year should the company choose not to conduct a second survey.",4,"The answer correctly states that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year and that the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions using Equation W-30. The answer also correctly states that facilities do not need to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year. However, the answer also includes additional information about tables with population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors, which is not directly relevant to the question.",5,"The answer clearly states that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year and if multiple surveys are conducted, the results from each survey must be used for emission calculations. It also states that facilities do not need to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year. The answer is logically consistent with the information provided in the context.",2,0.3368983957,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year and if multiple surveys are conducted, the results from each survey must be used for emission calculations. It also mentions that facilities do not need to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year. The answer also provides additional information about tables with population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for various equipment and services related to natural gas production and transmission, which is relevant to the topic.",843,,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"The document outlines the requirements for conducting equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations, including the option to conduct surveys over multiple years not exceeding a five-year period. It also specifies the approval criteria and timing for requesting extensions to use best available monitoring methods. Additionally, it details the calculation of emission factors based on annual equipment leak surveys and the conditions for submitting proposed MRV plans to the EPA. However, it does not explicitly address the possibility of a sunset provision for annual leak surveys if no leaking components are found year after year. The document contains various tables providing default average component counts, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for different equipment and services in the petroleum and natural gas industry. These tables can be used to calculate emissions and assess the environmental impact of equipment operations. However, there is no specific mention of a sunset provision or the potential for exemption from annual leak surveys in the absence of leaking components.","The document outlines the requirements for conducting equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations, including the option to conduct surveys over multiple years not exceeding a five-year period.

}","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information about the document's content related to monitoring and measurement of equipment components in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting sectors.

113,What types of instruments are permissible for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W?,"The document provides information on the permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W. The permissible instruments include Method 21, acoustic leak detection devices, optical gas imaging instruments, and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments. Method 21 specifies that a leak is detected if an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured. Acoustic leak detection devices are used to detect through-valve leakage, and a leak is detected if a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated. Similarly, infrared laser beam illuminated instruments are used for equipment leak detection, and a leak is detected if 10,000 ppm or greater is measured. Optical gas imaging instruments are used for inaccessible source types, and a leak is designated if 10,000 ppm or greater is measured, unless screened with Method 21 monitoring. Additionally, the document contains various tables providing default emission factors and population emission factors for different components and services related to natural gas production and transmission. These tables can be used to calculate emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions of CO2, as well as for conducting leak detection surveys and reporting information related to equipment leaks.","The permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include Method 21, acoustic leak detection devices, optical gas imaging instruments, and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments.

It specifies the components subject to well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards and the methods for conducting surveys and calculating emissions. The document also outlines the requirements for reporting emissions from different industry segments and the use of specific leak detection methods for estimating emissions. The equations provided in the document explain the calculation methods for deriving emissions from the data. For example, equations such as E = COUNT * EF and E = Fuel * EF describe how to derive the emission from the data. The extraction explains that COUNT is the number of units and EF is the emission factor. Additionally, the document contains tables with default emission factors for different components and equipment, which can be used to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q). These tables provide emission factors for various components and equipment, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps, which are essential for estimating fugitive emissions. Therefore, data from a state permit-required fugitive emissions monitoring program with a lower leak detection rate of 500 ppm can be used to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q) using the information and calculation methods provided in the document.","The document provides detailed information about the equipment leak surveys, reporting requirements, and calculation methods for various emissions, including CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorinated GHGs.

The document also outlines the requirements for reporting emissions from different industry segments and the use of specific leak detection methods for estimating emissions. The equations provided in the document explain the calculation methods for deriving emissions from the data. For example, equations such as E = COUNT * EF and E = Fuel * EF describe how to derive the emission from the data. The extraction explains that COUNT is the number of units and EF is the emission factor. Additionally, the document contains tables with default emission factors for different components and equipment, which can be used to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q). These tables provide emission factors for various components and equipment, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps, which are essential for estimating fugitive emissions.

It also specifies the parameters to be determined for characterizing emissions from dehydrators and the information to be reported for each acid gas removal unit. The definition of acid gas removal unit (AGR) is also provided, stating that it separates hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas using liquid or solid absorbents or membrane separators. Based on this information, acid gas removal units used only to sweeten a liquid stream may not meet the definition of acid gas removal units as they are specifically designed for sour natural gas.","The document provides detailed information about the calculation methods for emissions from acid gas removal (AGR) vents, specifically for CO2.

The document mentions that if all emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, they must be adjusted downward by the magnitude of the recovered emissions. Therefore, the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero. This indicates that even if all emissions are recovered and transferred outside the facility, the facility is still required to calculate the emissions and then reduce them to zero as per the regulations.",4,0.4852071006,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the regulations regarding the calculation and reduction of emissions from an AGR unit, and all sentences fit together naturally and coherently.",526,,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"The document provides information related to the performance test for acid gas removal units, including unique identifiers, acid gas content, site-specific emission factor method, and calculation methods for CO2 emissions. It also mentions the requirement to report the annual quantity of CO2 emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. The document includes details on conducting performance tests for nitric acid and adipic acid production processes, as well as the injection of CO2 streams into subsurface geologic formations. It also covers monitoring and reporting requirements for various emissions, such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, from different processes and equipment. However, specific numbers related to emissions estimation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The document also contains tables with default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and processes, which can be used in emission calculations. These tables provide values for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps, which can be used in emission factor calculations. The document does not explicitly provide a formula or method for estimating emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.","The document contains information related to the performance test for acid gas removal units, including the unique name or ID number for the unit, acid gas content of feed and outlet natural gas, site-specific emission factor method, and calculation methods for CO2 emissions from the acid gas removal unit.

If there is no scheduled shutdown within three consecutive calendar years, the measurement must be taken at the next scheduled depressurized shutdown. Additionally, the document outlines methods for performing measurements from individual centrifugal compressor sources and reciprocating compressor sources, as well as providing details on the calculation of total injection pump system volume and the measurement of blowdown valve leakage and wet seal oil degassing vents. It also mentions monitoring requirements for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers and the frequency of measurement and sampling for estimating emissions based on monitoring of equipment.","The document specifies that for compressors measured in not-operating-depressurized-mode, the measurement of volumetric emissions from isolation valve leakage must be done at least once in any three consecutive calendar years, provided the measurement can be taken during a scheduled shutdown.

It also mentions monitoring requirements for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers and the frequency of measurement and sampling for estimating emissions based on monitoring of equipment. However, it does not directly answer the question about EPA approval of BAMM for measuring isolation valves.",5,"The document clearly specifies the measurement requirements for isolation valve leakage at compressors in the not-operating-depressurized mode, stating that the measurement must be done at least once in any three consecutive calendar years, provided it can be taken during a scheduled shutdown. If there is no scheduled shutdown within three consecutive calendar years, the measurement must be taken at the next scheduled depressurized shutdown. Additionally, the document outlines methods for performing measurements from individual centrifugal compressor sources and reciprocating compressor sources, as well as providing details on the calculation of total injection pump system volume and the measurement of blowdown valve leakage and wet seal oil degassing vents. It also mentions monitoring requirements for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers and the frequency of measurement and sampling for estimating emissions based on monitoring of equipment.",1,0.2222222222,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate summary of the document's requirements for measuring isolation valve leakage at compressors in the not-operating-depressurized mode, as well as outlining methods for performing measurements from individual centrifugal compressor sources and reciprocating compressor sources, and providing details on the calculation of total injection pump system volume and the measurement of blowdown valve leakage and wet seal oil degassing vents.

It outlines methods for conducting volumetric emission measurements, continuous monitoring, and calculation of GHG emissions from individual and manifolded groups of compressor sources. Additionally, it specifies the requirements for conducting as found measurements and continuous measurement data. The document also mentions the use of permanent meters for measuring volumetric flow and provides equations for calculating annual volumetric GHG emissions associated with each manifolded group of compressor sources. However, there are no specific details provided regarding the approval of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold.","The document provides detailed information about the measurement and monitoring of manifolded compressor sources, including centrifugal and reciprocating compressors.

It also mentions specific absorbents such as desiccant, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or triethylene glycol. Additionally, it outlines requirements for dehydrator absorbent circulation rate, closed-loop systems, moisture content determination, and classification of wet natural gas. The text also specifies reporting requirements for facilities containing different types of dehydrators based on their natural gas throughput. The provided tables contain population emission factors for different components and material types in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. Another table provides default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. regions.","The text provides a detailed definition of a dehydrator as a device that uses a liquid absorbent to directly contact a natural gas stream to absorb water vapor.

The answer addresses all the important aspects of the question and is highly relevant.",1,"The answer does not follow logically from the information contained in the context. The context provides detailed requirements for reporting emissions from dehydrator vents based on the daily natural gas throughput. It specifies different calculation methods for dehydrators with throughputs greater than or less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, as well as for desiccant dehydrators. The calculation methods involve parameters such as natural gas flow rate, absorbent circulation rate, gas composition, and outlet natural gas water content. The document also outlines adjustments for emissions if routed to vapor recovery systems or flares/regenerator fire-box/fire tubes. The answer talks about emission methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd in the preamble contradicting the requirements in the rule, which is not mentioned in the context.",1,0.2007434944,1,"The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the requirements for reporting emissions from dehydrator vents based on the daily natural gas throughput.

131,"For onshore petroleum and natural gas facility dehydrator vents at glycol dehydrators with throughputs less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, can GRI-GLYCalc be used instead of Method 2 in §98.233(e)(2)?","The document specifies that for onshore petroleum and natural gas facility dehydrator vents with throughputs less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, GRI-GLYCalc can be used instead of Method 2 in §98.233(e)(2). It also outlines the parameters to be determined for characterizing emissions from dehydrators and provides equations for calculating annual volumetric emissions. Additionally, the document contains tables with default emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, which can be used in the calculation of emissions. However, no specific equations or formulas were provided in the text for further analysis.","The document provides detailed information about the reporting requirements and calculation methods for emissions from dehydrator vents in onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities. It specifies different calculation methods for dehydrators with different throughputs, including the use of GRI-GLYCalc for dehydrators with throughputs less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day. The document also outlines the parameters to be determined for characterizing emissions from dehydrators and provides equations for calculating annual volumetric emissions. Overall, it confirms that GRI-GLYCalc can be used instead of Method 2 in §98.233(e)(2) for onshore petroleum and natural gas facility dehydrator vents with throughputs less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day.{

136,Does a simple open pipe with no flare tip count as a flare under 98.233 (n ) in Subpart W?,"The document provides detailed information about various equations and tables related to emission factors, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for different components and equipment in the context of environmental regulations. It explains the calculation methods and factors used to determine emissions from various sources such as natural gas production facilities, crude oil production equipment, and natural gas transmission compression. The tables provide specific emission factors for different components and equipment in different regions of the U.S., along with the average component counts for major equipment. However, the text does not directly address the specific question about whether a simple open pipe with no flare tip counts as a flare under 98.233(n) in Subpart W. Based on the definition of a flare provided in the text, it can be inferred that a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not meet the criteria to be considered a flare under the specified regulation, as it does not involve combustion or a flame.","Based on the information provided, a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not count as a flare under 98.233(n) in Subpart W. The text mentions that a flare is a combustion device that uses an open flame to burn combustible gases with combustion air provided by uncontrolled ambient air around the flame. It also specifies that a flare uses an open or closed flame to combust waste gases without energy recovery. Since a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not involve combustion or a flame, it does not meet the criteria to be considered a flare under the specified regulation.{
