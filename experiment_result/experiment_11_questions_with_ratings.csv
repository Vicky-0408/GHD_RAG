1,Who is required to report under subpart W?,"Owners and operators of facilities subject to subpart W of part 98 are required to report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary fuel combustion sources using the methods specified in § 98.233(z). Additionally, underground natural gas storage facilities must utilize the appropriate default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service as listed in Table W–4B to this subpart. The population emission factors for various components and services in the Eastern and Western U.S. are also provided in the tables. The component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment are specified. Furthermore, the default average component counts for major crude oil production equipment are outlined. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also included. Emission factors for different survey methods and components in onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression, as well as for underground natural gas storage, are detailed in the tables. Therefore, entities falling under subpart W are required to report as per the mentioned criteria and utilize the specified emission factors for accurate reporting.","Owners and operators of facilities that are subject to subpart W of part 98 are required to report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary fuel combustion sources following the methods specified in § 98.233(z).

2,What GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities are covered under the rule?,No answer found,No context found,"Subpart W of part 98 requires petroleum and natural gas facilities to report annual methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from equipment leaks and venting, and emissions of CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) from flaring, onshore production stationary and portable combustion emissions, and combustion emissions from stationary equipment involved in natural gas distribution. Facilities covered by this rule might also be required to report emissions under other subparts of the GHG Reporting Program, if applicable.  The GHG Reporting Program requires reporting of GHG emissions: CO2, CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated GHGs: hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases.  These gases are often expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e).",1,The answer completely lacks relevance as it does not provide any information related to the question.,1,"The answer is not present in the context, so it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.0,5,The answer straightforwardly says that it doesn't know and makes no attempt to answer the question.,1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the question asked.,15,,
3,Will EPA provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule?,"Yes, the EPA will provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule. The EPA defines a facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production and includes onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment. The tool will assist in determining the applicability of these regulations to the specific equipment and operations described. Additionally, detailed emission factors and average component counts for different regions and equipment types are provided, which can be used in conjunction with the EPA's tool to assess applicability and compliance with the regulations.","Yes, the EPA will provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule. The EPA defines facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or common control including leased, rented, or contracted activities by an onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator and that are located in a single hydrocarbon basin. This includes onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment. The tool will assist in determining the applicability of these regulations to the specific equipment and operations described.{

6,How is the petroleum and natural gas systems source category defined?,"The petroleum and natural gas systems source category is defined by the equipment and activities involved in the extraction, production, and processing of petroleum and natural gas. This includes various segments such as natural gas processing, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, and offshore petroleum and natural gas production. The equipment involved encompasses gathering pipelines, compressors, separators, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, flares, and various other components. Additionally, it covers the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary and portable fuel combustion sources, as well as the reporting of emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. Furthermore, specific emission factors and population emission factors for different components and equipment in various locations are considered in the definition of this source category.","The petroleum and natural gas systems source category includes various segments such as natural gas processing, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, and offshore petroleum and natural gas production. It involves equipment used in the extraction, production, transportation, and processing of petroleum and natural gas. The category encompasses gathering pipelines, compressors, separators, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, flares, and various other components. It also includes natural gas processing plants responsible for the separation of natural gas liquids (NGLs) or non-methane gases from produced natural gas, with specific criteria for annual average throughput. Additionally, it covers the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary and portable fuel combustion sources, as well as the reporting of emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. Therefore, the petroleum and natural gas systems source category is defined by the equipment and activities involved in the extraction, production, and processing of petroleum and natural gas, along with the specific emissions reporting requirements for different segments.{

You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control.

See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors.

","Starting in 2013 and each year thereafter, reports must be submitted to EPA by March 31 of each year, unless the 31st is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, in which case the reports are due on the next business day.  Facilities subject to subpart W must begin monitoring GHG emissions on January 1, 2011 in accordance with the methods specified in subpart W. For 2012 only, the GHG report must be submitted to EPA by September 28, 2012. This reporting deadline applies to all subparts being reported by the facility. If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",,,5,The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by stating that reporting for subpart W begins immediately for facilities that are subject to it. It also correctly mentions that best engineering estimates can be used for data related to newly acquired sources for the first 6 months. The additional information about emission factors and component counts is relevant but not necessary for answering the question.,1,0.1904761905,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent and provides relevant information about when reporting for subpart W begins, as well as additional details about the emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting equipment, and crude oil production equipment in different locations within the U.S. However, it also acknowledges the incomplete and unclear nature of the provided LaTeX equations, which require further context or clarification for accurate interpretation and analysis.",673,,
12,Is there any way we can get unlocked subpart W screening spreadsheets from the applicability tool?,No answer found,No context found,"No. EPA’s intention in posting subpart W calculation utilities is to provide facilities with a simple tool for estimating emissions when determining applicability.  Additionally, the tools include a guidance and source tab to document how emission estimates were calculated.  The utilities are only a guide to help facilities determine their subpart W applicability.  If you suspect a facility may exceed the annual 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold, you should refer to the calculation methodologies in 98.233 to determine emissions.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance as it does not provide any information related to the question.,1,"The answer does not provide any information related to the question. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.027027027,5,The answer straightforwardly says that it doesn't know and makes no attempt to answer the question.,1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the question asked.,15,,
13,The applicability tool for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas has an operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons. How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities is directly correlated with the total annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to applicable onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks, in barrels. This correlation is based on the amount of oil produced and handled at the facility. Additionally, the tables provide detailed component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, and crude oil production equipment, which can be used to further analyze and understand the factors influencing the operating factor for associated gas venting.","The operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities correlates with the total annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to applicable onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks, in barrels.

}","EPA has provided guidance on the operating factor in the Notes section, where it states, “This is defined as the fraction of time the process unit is operating in a calendar year.  For example, a 90% operating factor would be entered as 0.9 because the unit is in operation for 90% of the year.”",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how the operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities correlates with the total annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to applicable onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks, in barrels. The answer also mentions that this correlation is based on the amount of oil produced and handled at the facility, and provides additional information from the tables to further analyze and understand the factors influencing the operating factor for associated gas venting.",5,"The answer directly and logically follows from the information provided in the context. It states that the operating factor for associated gas venting is directly correlated with the total annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to applicable onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks, in barrels.

14,Where can I find the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production involves analyzing emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. It should consider specific source types identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. The tool should also account for the GHG mole fraction in produced natural gas and flash gas, as well as the emissions from atmospheric tanks and combustion-related emissions from stationary or portable equipment. Additionally, it should calculate CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions based on geographic location and equipment type, considering average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions for actual temperature and pressure. The tool should account for the total annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells, as well as the total quantity of gas handled at the offshore platform. Finally, the tool should report information specified in paragraphs (r)(1)(i) through (v) of this section separately by component type, service type, and geographic location (Eastern U.S. or Western U.S.). The tool's design and parameters can be further refined using the population emission factors, average component counts, leaker emission factors, and total hydrocarbon emission factors provided for various equipment and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. as well as for natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground storage, LNG storage, and natural gas distribution.","The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production can be found by analyzing the emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

15,Does EPA offer guidance on how to estimate a worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for purpose of determining applicability?,"Yes, the EPA offers comprehensive guidance for estimating worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability. The guidance includes specific procedures for calculating emissions, conducting emissions tests, using alternative methods, maintaining records, and reporting requirements. It covers a wide range of factors such as process modifications, operating hours, production changes, fuel or raw material use, addition of equipment, facility expansion, and more. Additionally, it outlines the use of best available monitoring methods, alternative methods, and approval criteria for certain units. The guidance also specifies the use of specific EPA methods for monitoring and testing, including the use of EPA Method 21 for monitoring fluorinated GHGs. In addition to the textual guidance, there are extensive tables providing emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and locations related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression. The tables include data for different locations in the Eastern and Western U.S., along with detailed emission factors for components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic device vents, pumps, and gathering pipelines. The guidance also covers leaker emission factors, population emission factors, and methane emission factors for specific equipment and processes. Therefore, the EPA not only provides textual guidance but also comprehensive tabular data to support the estimation of worst case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks.","Yes, the EPA provides extensive guidance on estimating GHG emissions from various sources including transmission storage tanks.

The equations and text mention various factors, such as mass or volume of fuel combusted, high heat value of the fuel, emission factors, and specific emissions from different processes. It also includes details about the conversion factors and parameters for calculating emissions from different sources. However, due to the fragmented nature of the input, the exact context and relationships between the equations and text are not entirely clear.""

16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting because different default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors are used for each. For transmission compression, the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in Table W–3A to this subpart are used. Whereas for underground natural gas storage, the appropriate default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4B to this subpart are used.

The presentation can be found on the official EPA website under the relevant subpart for petroleum and natural gas systems. In addition, the analysis of the provided LaTeX equations and tables reveals that they are related to environmental regulations, emissions calculations, and factors such as conversion factors, stoichiometric ratios, emission factors, and inventory calculations. The tables also include data on emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as population emission factors for natural gas transmission compression and underground gas storage. These factors and calculations are likely relevant to the reporting rule and environmental impact assessments for petroleum and natural gas facilities.","Yes, there is a PowerPoint presentation available on the reporting rule signed by Administrator Jackson on November 8, 2010 for the petroleum and natural gas facilities.

    ""result"": ""The provided LaTeX equations are a mix of different types of content, including some equations, text, and symbols. However, the majority of the content seems to be related to environmental regulations and emissions calculations. The equations involve various factors such as conversion factors, stoichiometric ratios, emission factors, and inventory calculations. Additionally, some equations involve specific substances such as CO2, N2O, and various types of fuels. The context suggests that these equations are likely related to emissions reporting, fuel consumption, and environmental impact assessments.""

}","If the power take-off for operating the truck mounted workover rig is the truck wheel drive engine (i.e. a transmission option to transfer the truck wheel drive shaft to powering the rig generator or wench or other rig equipment) then yes, this workover rig arrangement is “self propelled.” and not required to be reported.  However, if the truck has a separate engine not connected to the drive wheels that powers the workover rig equipment, then it is “non-self propelled” and must be included in your report.",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W. The answer also references the emission factors and component counts for major equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. to support the inclusion of these activities for reporting GHG emissions. The answer is highly relevant to the question and addresses all important aspects of the context.,5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It states that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W because they are integral to onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering/boosting facilities, and emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment at these facilities must be reported under Subpart W. The answer also provides additional support from the emission factors and component counts for major equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. that align with the conclusion drawn from the text analysis.",2,0.2142857143,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-written and coherent. It provides a clear and concise explanation of why self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W. The answer also references the emission factors and component counts for major equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. to support the conclusion.

27,What percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP?,"Emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP if emission sources specified in § 98.232 emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. Therefore, the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP depends on whether the specified emission threshold is met for each facility. The emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and distribution are provided in the tables. These factors can be used to estimate the emissions from different components and equipment, which in turn can contribute to determining whether the specified emission threshold for reporting under the GHGRP is met for each facility.","Emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP if emission sources specified in § 98.232 emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) was allowed for specific time periods, such as from January 1 to March 31 of reporting years, when it was not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate required monitoring equipment. However, the use of BAMM had strict deadlines and was generally not approved beyond certain dates, except for unique and extreme circumstances like safety, technical infeasibility, or inconsistency with other regulations. Requests for extension of BAMM usage had to be submitted for approval and were subject to specific criteria. Overall, the use of BAMM was limited to certain timeframes and required careful adherence to regulatory requirements. Additionally, the provided data includes population emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions. The data also contains default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and default total hydrocarbon emission factors for various processes related to natural gas and crude oil production. The emission factors are specified for different survey methods and components, providing insights into the emissions associated with the equipment and processes.","The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) was allowed for specific time periods, such as from January 1 to March 31 of reporting years, when it was not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate required monitoring equipment. However, the use of BAMM had strict deadlines and was generally not approved beyond certain dates, except for unique and extreme circumstances like safety, technical infeasibility, or inconsistency with other regulations. Requests for extension of BAMM usage had to be submitted for approval and were subject to specific criteria. Overall, the use of BAMM was limited to certain timeframes and required careful adherence to regulatory requirements.{
    ""result"": ""The provided data contains a list of various equations and their explanations. However, the equations and explanations are presented in a format that is not clearly understandable. It seems that the equations are related to emissions, conversion factors, and various factors affecting emissions such as combustion efficiency, stoichiometric ratios, and emission factors. The explanations appear to involve chemical compositions, measurement periods, and inventory of gases. However, due to the unclear format and incomplete nature of the provided data, it is not possible to provide a detailed analysis or interpretation of the equations and explanations.""

Instead, it provides information on population emission factors and default emission factors for various components and processes related to natural gas and crude oil production. While this information may be useful in understanding emissions, it does not answer the specific question asked.",3,0.358662614,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation of the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) and its limitations. It also includes relevant information about population emission factors and default emission factors for various processes related to natural gas and crude oil production. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples or data to support the claims made.",1375,,
32,How does the petroleum and natural gas systems data reported under the GHGRP compare to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB)?,No answer found,No context found,"The GHGRP covers the same sources of emissions in California as CARB, but there are differences in the reporting thresholds as well as how facilities are defined.  CARB has a different definition for onshore production facilities than the GHGRP.  The practical implication is that individual CARB facilities reporting under onshore production may be larger than comparable GHGRP facilities.  However, there will be more facilities in the GHGRP, and those facilities will cover the same emissions as the smaller number of CARB facilities.  It is not expected that the total emissions covered will be different between the GHGRP and CARB.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question.,1,"The answer is not present, therefore it is not possible to determine whether it is true or false without further information.",1,0.0,5,"The answer straightforwardly states that no answer was found, indicating a high level of uncertainty and lack of knowledge.",1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the question asked.,15,,
33,"What are the notification requirements when an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin?","Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report specific information for each major equipment type, production type (natural gas or crude oil), and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C. This reporting is necessary when equipment leak emissions are calculated using the methodology in § 98.233(r). Additionally, facilities must report emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment if emission sources specified in § 98.232(j) emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The tables provide detailed component counts for major equipment types in both the Eastern and Western U.S., along with the designation of states in each region.","Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report the information specified in paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, for each major equipment type, production type (i.e., natural gas or crude oil), and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C to this subpart for which equipment leak emissions are calculated using the methodology in § 98.233(r).

It correctly states that facilities must report specific information for each major equipment type, production type, and geographic location combination in Tables W-1B and W-1C, and that reporting is necessary when equipment leak emissions are calculated using the methodology in § 98.233(r). Additionally, it correctly states that facilities must report emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment if emission sources specified in § 98.232(j) emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The answer also provides additional information about the tables and the designation of states in each region, which is relevant to the question.

35,What are the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available?,"When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available, annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b) to determine the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations. Additionally, specific population emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, crude oil production, and natural gas processing are provided for both Eastern and Western U.S. These factors can be utilized to estimate GHG emissions in the absence of a continuous gas composition analyzer. The data also includes default average component counts for major equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states, and emission factors for underground natural gas storage and LNG storage. Utilizing this information, along with the prescribed methods in § 98.234(b), can aid in determining GHG mole fraction for emission calculations in the absence of a continuous gas composition analyzer.","When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available, annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b) to determine the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations.{

36,What are the requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare?,"To determine the volume of gas sent to a flare, you can use a continuous flow measurement device on the flare if available. If all the flare gas is not measured by the existing flow measurement device, then the flow not measured can be estimated using engineering calculations based on best available data or company records. If there is no continuous flow measurement device on the flare, engineering calculations based on process knowledge, company records, and best available data can be used. Additionally, the calculation of the volume of gas sent to the flare can involve various factors such as flow rates, measurement periods, higher heating value, temperature, pressure, and gas composition. Therefore, the determination of the volume of gas sent to a flare requires careful consideration of these factors and compliance with the specific calculation methods outlined in the regulations. Furthermore, the determination of the volume of gas sent to a flare can also be influenced by emission factors and component counts, as well as leaker emission factors and population emission factors specific to onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, natural gas processing plants, and natural gas transmission compression. These factors provide valuable data for accurate determination and management of gas sent to a flare.","To determine the volume of gas sent to a flare, you can use a continuous flow measurement device on the flare if available.

41,How do I determine applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources?,"To determine the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit must be reported following the requirements of subpart C (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), except for flares. This includes combustion units such as boilers, process heaters, and other miscellaneous combustion sources. Additionally, specific reporting requirements exist for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities. Facilities containing stationary fuel combustion sources must report GHG emissions under Subpart W if they meet the applicability requirements outlined in 40 CFR 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). Therefore, the determination of applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources is based on meeting the specified requirements and emission thresholds. In addition, detailed emission factors and component counts for various equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering are available for both the Eastern and Western U.S. These factors include population emission factors for different components and materials, as well as leaker emission factors for different survey methods. The data also covers leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, providing comprehensive information for assessing emissions in these facilities.","To determine the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit must be reported following the requirements of subpart C (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), except for flares.

Additionally, the tables provided contain emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. regions, as well as the designation of states in each region.","Based on the provided information, sites in south Louisiana located within the State boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous (not in Federal waters but subject to the ebb and flow of the tide) are considered offshore as they are within the definition of offshore production facilities, which includes platform structures affixed temporarily or permanently to offshore submerged lands, equipment to extract hydrocarbons from the ocean or lake floor, and processing and/or transferring such hydrocarbons to storage or transport vessels.{

}","The definition for offshore in § 98.238 includes “lakes or other normally standing waters”, therefore, sites located in lakes, bays, etc are considered offshore.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, citing the provided information and defining the term 'offshore production facilities' which includes the relevant sites in south Louisiana. Additionally, the answer goes above and beyond by mentioning the emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. regions, as well as the designation of states in each region.",5,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question, stating that sites in south Louisiana located within the State boundaries in lakes, bays, and bayous (not in Federal waters but subject to the ebb and flow of the tide) are considered offshore as they are within the definition of offshore production facilities. This is supported by the provided context, which defines offshore production facilities to include platform structures affixed temporarily or permanently to offshore submerged lands, equipment to extract hydrocarbons from the ocean or lake floor, and processing and/or transferring such hydrocarbons to storage or transport vessels.",3,0.213740458,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear explanation based on the provided information.

}","Yes. The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, stating that the offshore facility would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011. The answer also provides specific details about the emissions from subpart W sources and stationary combustion sources, which meet the requirement for reporting GHG emissions. Additionally, the answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic by referencing the equations and data from the tables to provide further insights into the emission factors and component counts for natural gas production and gathering equipment, crude oil production equipment, and leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It explicitly states that the offshore facility would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011 based on the emissions from subpart W sources and stationary combustion sources, which meets the requirement for reporting GHG emissions. The additional information provided in the tables and equations further supports this conclusion.",5,0.296875,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and direct response to the question, and also includes additional relevant information about emission factors and component counts for natural gas production and gathering equipment, crude oil production equipment, and leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities.",590,,
47,"Can we use 2011 BOEMRE data, rather than the previously available data from 2008, for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility?","Yes, the 2011 BOEMRE data can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility. The regulations stipulate that offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction must report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in the data collection and emissions estimation study referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 (GOADS). Additionally, the provided table data includes population emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, which can be utilized for emissions reporting and analysis.","Yes, 2011 BOEMRE data can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility. The regulations state that offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction shall report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in the data collection and emissions estimation study published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 (GOADS).

48,"If an offshore oil and gas production platform or facility is farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, does that facility have to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C?","Based on the information provided, offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions as per the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. This reporting requirement applies regardless of whether the facility is located beyond the limit of state waters. Therefore, the facility must report emissions data to the EPA for Subpart C. Additionally, the tables provide detailed emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as leaker emission factors for various components. These tables can be used for emissions calculations and reporting compliance.","Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. Therefore, if an offshore oil and gas production platform or facility is farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, it has to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C.{

49,By when do onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report?,"Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types. For onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, the reporting must include information specified in paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) for each major equipment type, production type, and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C. Offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction should report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE, while those not under BOEMRE jurisdiction must use the most recent monitoring methods and calculation methods published by BOEMRE to calculate and report annual emissions. Additionally, the emission factors and average component counts for major equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided in the tables, which are essential for the accurate reporting of emissions as per the specified requirements.","Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emission source types.

}","Therefore, if the facility is subject to the rule and is under BOEMRE jurisdiction but is a new facility that is not included in the most recently published GOADs report, then you must calculate calendar year 2011 emissions for equipment leaks, vent, and flare emission sources using the GOADS methodologies in the most recently published GOADS report. New facilities, whether or not under GOADS jurisdiction, have to follow 98.233(s)(4), which states, “For either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions.”",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how new offshore facilities subject to GOADS should report their emissions in 2012. It correctly states that since published GOADS data are not available, these facilities should use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE, as referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 250.304, to calculate and report annual emissions. It also correctly states that these facilities should utilize the GOADS methodologies for emission calculation. The answer additionally mentions that specific emission factors for different components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering have been provided, which can be used as a reference for emission calculations.

How do you calculate emissions from leaking components if onshore petroleum and natural gas source are not required to monitor components?,"{'answer': 'The emissions factors listed in Table W-1A are indeed used for both leaking components and non-leaking components. For onshore petroleum and natural gas sources, the emissions from leaking components are estimated using the appropriate default whole gas population emission factors listed in Table W-1A.

Therefore, the emissions factors in Table W-1A apply to both leaking and non-leaking components, and the estimation of emissions from leaking components is based on the default whole gas population emission factors.

54,How should the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks be determined to compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1)?,"To determine the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks to compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1), you must calculate CH4, CO2, and N2O emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon produced liquids using the specified calculation methods. For gas-liquid separators with daily throughput of oil greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, use Calculation Method 1 or 2 as specified in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section. For wells flowing directly to atmospheric storage tanks without passing through a separator with throughput greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH4 and CO2 emissions using Calculation Method 2 as specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. If the throughput is less than 10 barrels per day, use Calculation Method 3 as specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. Therefore, the daily oil throughput should be calculated based on these methods to compare with the specified threshold. Additionally, the provided tables contain population emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. These factors can be used in the calculation of emissions and throughput for compliance and comparison with regulatory thresholds.","To determine the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks to compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1), you must calculate CH4, CO2, and N2O emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon produced liquids using the specified calculation methods.

55,Which calculation from 98.233(o) should be used for centrifugal compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities?,"The appropriate calculation for centrifugal compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities should be done using Equation W–25 of §98.233. This equation is specifically designed for calculating emissions from centrifugal compressor wet seal oil degassing vents at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. Therefore, Equation W–25 is the recommended method for this scenario. Additionally, the default whole gas emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment are available for further reference and analysis.","The calculation for centrifugal compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities should be done using Equation W–25 of this section.

}",Geologic provinces 160 (Appalachian Basin) and 160A (Appalachian Basin-Eastern Overthrust area) are two distinct basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production under Part 98.,,,5,"The answer directly addresses the question and logically follows from the information provided in the context. It states that geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, and therefore they are not considered as one basin.",5,0.347826087,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent as it directly and clearly answers the question asked about geologic provinces and basins for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. Additionally, the answer provides relevant information about emission factors and average component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S., as well as the designation of states in each region, which can be valuable for understanding the operational and environmental aspects of onshore petroleum and natural gas production in these regions.",619,,
62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to monitor and regulate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and combustion sources. This reporting is essential for tracking and managing greenhouse gas emissions from the production, extraction, recovery, and processing of petroleum and natural gas. The requirement ensures that emissions from facilities in different basins can be accurately measured and controlled to mitigate environmental impact. Additionally, the provided tables contain population emission factors for different components and services in the Eastern and Western U.S., as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. These tables likely provide important data for calculating and estimating emissions, which further underscores the significance of reporting by basin for effective monitoring and regulation of emissions.","The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to monitor and regulate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and combustion sources.

}","Facilities have several options to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring.  If the GOR from each well is not available, EPA has provided flexibility in 40 CFR 98.233(m) and the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category shall be used. If GOR is still not available, then an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization or industry standard practice (as described in 40 CFR 98.234(b)) may be used.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the procedures and alternative methods available to facilities for determining GOR for associated gas venting and flaring when a GOR value for a well is not available. Additionally, the answer mentions the use of default emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and equipment involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and distribution, which can be used to estimate the GOR for associated gas venting and flaring in the absence of specific GOR values for individual wells. The answer addresses all the important aspects of the question and is highly relevant to the context.",5,"The answer provides clear and accurate information about the options available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring when a facility does not have a GOR value for a well. It mentions the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(A) or (B) of the section, alternative methods for determining the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) when the GOR cannot be determined from available data, and the option to use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category if GOR from each individual well is not available.

64,What are the optional delayed reporting requirements for wildcat wells and delineation wells?,"For wildcat wells and delineation wells, the reporting of gas to oil ratio (GOR) and volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production can be delayed if indicated in the annual report. However, if delayed, the GOR and oil production volume must be reported by the date specified in § 98.236(cc) along with the well ID number for each well. Therefore, the optional delayed reporting requirements for wildcat wells and delineation wells include the GOR and volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production. Additionally, there is detailed data on emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves, categorized by different services and regions in the U.S.","For wildcat wells and delineation wells, the reporting of gas to oil ratio (GOR) and volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production can be delayed if indicated in the annual report.

65,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my oil well operations to decide whether I need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, you can use Equation W–12C of § 98.233 to calculate the gas to oil ratio for the well in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil. If GOR cannot be determined from available data, procedures specified in paragraph (l)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section can be used to determine GOR. If the GOR from each well is not available, the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category can be used. Additionally, for well venting during well completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing that have a GOR of 300 scf/STB or greater, emissions must be reported. Therefore, based on the information provided, you can determine the GOR for your oil well operations and decide whether reporting emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing is necessary. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, which can be used to assess and manage emissions during oil well operations.","To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, you can use Equation W–12C of § 98.233 to calculate the gas to oil ratio for the well in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil.

66,How should a gathering and boosting facility that previously reporting under Subpart C report in RY2016?,"Based on the provided information, the facility involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting is required to report under Subpart C in RY2016 if it meets the specified criteria. The facility includes gathering pipelines, compressors, process equipment, and other equipment used to collect petroleum and/or natural gas from onshore production gas or oil wells. This encompasses equipment used for compression, dehydration, sweetening, or transportation of the petroleum and/or natural gas to natural gas processing facilities, natural gas transmission pipelines, or natural gas distribution pipelines. It's important to note that the facility should not include equipment and pipelines that are part of any other industry segment.

Additionally, the emission factors and component counts for the Eastern and Western U.S. regions are provided for various components and services, including gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service, and gathering pipelines by material type. These factors and counts are essential for calculating and reporting emissions related to onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting.

The data also includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, as well as default average component counts for major crude oil production equipment. This information aids in estimating the number of components and valves for different equipment types.

Furthermore, the default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting, along with total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression, are provided. These factors are crucial for estimating emissions and compliance reporting.

The data also includes default methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, underground natural gas storage, and LNG import and export equipment. These factors are important for assessing methane emissions and ensuring regulatory compliance.

In conclusion, the gathering and boosting facility that previously reported under Subpart C should continue to report in RY2016, and the provided emission factors and component counts are valuable for accurate emissions calculations and reporting.","For reporting under Subpart C in RY2016, the facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting includes gathering pipelines, compressors, process equipment, and other equipment used to collect petroleum and/or natural gas from onshore production gas or oil wells. This includes equipment used to compress, dehydrate, sweeten, or transport the petroleum and/or natural gas to a natural gas processing facility, a natural gas transmission pipeline, or to a natural gas distribution pipeline. It does not include equipment and pipelines that are part of any other industry segment. Therefore, the gathering and boosting facility that previously reported under Subpart C should continue to report in RY2016 if it meets the specified criteria.{

In addition to this, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for different equipment and locations related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These tables provide detailed information about emission factors for various components and equipment used in the natural gas industry, including valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves. However, the tables do not directly address the specific question about whether the inclusion in the source category is based on annual average daily flow or max design capacity.","Section 98.230(a)(3) states that processing plants that do not fractionate but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the source category.

71,"What is the definition of  ""fractionate"" and ""fractionation"" in 98.230(a)(3)?","In the context of 98.230(a)(3), fractionate and fractionation refer to the process of separating natural gas liquids (NGLs) into individual component products such as ethane, propane, butanes, and pentane-plus. NGL fractionators are required to use measurements at custody transfer meters or similar meters to determine the NGL product slate delivered from the fractionation facility. Additionally, if a NGL fractionator supplies a product that is a mixture or blend of two or more products, they are required to report the quantities of the constituents of the mixtures or blends separately. This process is essential for the accurate measurement and reporting of NGL products in the natural gas industry. The equations and emission factors provided in the analysis are related to the quantification and assessment of emissions and fuel usage in the context of natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as the designation of regions and specific equipment counts for crude oil and natural gas production. These equations and factors are used to calculate annual CO2 emissions, emission factors, and population emission factors for various components and services, including leaker emission factors, methane emission factors, and natural gas usage. The data also includes default average component counts for major equipment, such as wellheads, separators, meters/piping, compressors, in-line heaters, and dehydrators, in different regions of the United States.","Fractionate and fractionation, in the context of 98.230(a)(3), refers to the process of separating natural gas liquids (NGLs) into individual component products such as ethane, propane, butanes, and pentane-plus.

The underground storage facility includes processes such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement which are essential components shared with the natural gas processing plant. Therefore, they can be considered as a single facility for reporting purposes. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts provided for onshore natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression can be utilized to calculate and report emissions for the combined facility. The data on leaker emission factors, hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors can be leveraged to assess and report the environmental impact of the combined facility as well.","Yes, a natural gas processing plant and an underground storage facility can report as one combined facility if they share compression.

77,Are facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams (and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane) subject to subpart W?,"Facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams (and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane) are subject to subpart W. The provided text describes the distinction between fractionators and natural gas processing plants, indicating that fractionators specifically handle the fractionation of natural gas liquids into constituent liquid products or mixtures of products. Therefore, based on the information provided, these facilities would be subject to subpart W. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts provided in the tables support the regulatory implications for such facilities, as they outline the potential emissions associated with various equipment and operations in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, further emphasizing the importance of subpart W compliance for fractionation facilities.","Facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams (and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane) are subject to subpart W.

}","The Rule states in §98.230(a) that the onshore natural gas processing industry includes all plants that fractionate, as well as all plants that do not fractionate that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.  Only those non-fractionating facilities with an annual average throughput of less than 25 MMscf per day would not be subject to reporting under subpart W even if the reporting threshold is triggered in Subpart C.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how to calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, which directly addresses the question and includes all important aspects of the context.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate formula for calculating the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, which is consistent with the information provided in the context.",1,0.2666666667,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,The answer is well-written and all the sentences fit together naturally.

}","However, please note that if, in year 2, your throughput capacity is less than 25 MMscf per day, you are not required to calculate and report GHG emissions from gas processing in year 2.  You would still be required to report other covered emissions at your facility.  This is because gas processing would not be an applicable segment for year 2.  Nevertheless, your facility would still be required to report in year 2, even if facility-wide emissions are less than 25,000mt CO2e, and would continue to report until you meet the criteria in 98.2(i) for ceasing to report.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.  This throughput is re-evaluated annually.  Once you are subject to the rule (e.g., your facility contains a source category listed in Table A-4), your facility must continue complying with all the requirements of this part, even if the facility does not meet the applicability requirements in a future year (i.e., 25,000 mtCO2e for petroleum and natural gas systems). The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",5,"The answer accurately provides the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and explains that the regulations do not specify a re-evaluation frequency, but the facility should monitor its throughput regularly to ensure compliance with the threshold and maintain accurate records. The answer also includes additional information on emission factors and component counts, which are relevant to the topic.",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and the re-evaluation frequency.

If the facility's emissions exceed 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year, it must report GHG emissions under Subpart W. The tables provide detailed information about emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and services related to natural gas production and gathering. However, these tables do not impact the precedence of the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold for Subpart W applicability.","To determine the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility, the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold under 98.2(a)(2) takes precedence. This means that if the facility's emissions exceed 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year, it must report GHG emissions under Subpart W.

","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, how to treat intermittent emission from the storage tank, and whether an alternative method can be used to quantify the emissions. The answer also includes additional information on population emission factors and emission factors for different components and services in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as for natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground storage, and LNG storage.",2,0.2723004695,,,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides clear and concise information about the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, how to treat intermittent emission from the storage tank, and whether an alternative method can be used to quantify the emissions.

88,"The definition of the onshore natural gas transmission compression includes ""any stationary combustion of compressors that move natural gas at elevated pressure","The onshore natural gas transmission compression involves the stationary combination of compressors to move natural gas from production fields, processing plants, or other transmission compressors through pipelines to distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or underground storage. This process also includes equipment for liquids separation and tanks for water and hydrocarbon liquid storage. The movement of natural gas at elevated pressure leads to the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources within the onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities. Additionally, the emission factors for various components and survey methods are provided for different equipment and services in both the Eastern and Western U.S. The emission factors cover leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors for different components and services related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, and storage. The data also includes default average component counts for major equipment and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states.","The onshore natural gas transmission compression includes any stationary combination of compressors that move natural gas from production fields, natural gas processing plants, or other transmission compressors through transmission pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage. This also includes equipment for liquids separation, and tanks for the storage of water and hydrocarbon liquids. The definition encompasses the movement of natural gas at elevated pressure and involves the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources within the onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities.{

91,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"Unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases are indeed subject to reporting, as specified in the text analysis. The regulations for reporting address vented emissions of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas, blowdown vent stack emissions, well venting for liquids unloading, and associated gas venting or flaring. Additionally, specific thresholds for reporting emissions from different industry segments are mentioned. The table analysis provides detailed population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as leaker emission factors for various components. This data can be used to quantify and report unintentional natural gas releases as required by the regulations.","Yes, unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases are subject to reporting, as specified in the text. Vented emissions of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas, blowdown vent stack emissions, well venting for liquids unloading, and associated gas venting or flaring are all addressed in the regulations for reporting. The text also mentions specific thresholds for reporting emissions from different industry segments. Therefore, unintentional natural gas releases are indeed subject to reporting.{

92,How do we report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir?,"{'answer': 'Emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir must be reported according to the specific equipment and activities at each facility. This involves reporting on equipment leaks, vented emissions, and the injection of CO2 streams for various purposes such as load balancing, acid gas disposal, and enhanced oil or natural gas recovery. The reporting also includes the use of default emission factors, conducting equipment leak surveys, and complying with the requirements of subpart W. Therefore, the emissions from separate facilities are individually assessed and reported based on the specific operations and equipment at each facility. Additionally, the default emission factors for different components and services in the Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, along with average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and crude oil production. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also outlined. Furthermore, emission factors for equipment leak surveys and total hydrocarbon emission factors for various processes, including onshore natural gas processing, natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage, are detailed.'}","Emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir must be reported according to the specific equipment and activities at each facility.

This determination is supported by the specific emission factors and component counts provided for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting equipment, and crude oil production equipment. The emission factors for leaker components and storage wellheads further reinforce that the high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations are not in the same category as underground natural gas storage facilities under Subpart W.","The natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W.{

94,"What is the definition of ""facility"" for underground storage?","The definition of 'facility' for underground natural gas storage encompasses subsurface storage in depleted gas or oil reservoirs and salt dome caverns for load balancing. It includes natural gas storage processes such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, excluding transmission pipelines. This definition also covers all the wellheads connected to the compression units located at the facility, which are responsible for injecting and recovering natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs. Additionally, there are emission factor tables and leaker emission factors provided for components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and meters, specific to different gas services and storage station scenarios. These factors are further categorized based on survey methods and are associated with the Eastern and Western U.S. states. However, the provided text also contains a mix of LaTeX equations and explanations related to emissions factors, conversion factors, and stoichiometric ratios, which lack clear context or labeling to provide a meaningful analysis.","The definition of 'facility' for underground natural gas storage includes subsurface storage in depleted gas or oil reservoirs and salt dome caverns for the primary purpose of load balancing.

It not only confirms that separate emission reports should be submitted by the respective operators of the underground natural gas storage facility and the second company jointly owning the storage wellheads, but also provides supporting evidence from the regulations, specific emission factors and component counts, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. The answer also references the default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage and the survey methods outlined in the data tables, which further emphasize the need for separate emission reports. Overall, the answer addresses all the important aspects of the question and provides a comprehensive and informative response.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. The regulations clearly state that for underground natural gas storage, the facility must report the information specified in the applicable paragraphs of the section separately. Therefore, each operator should submit their own separate emission reports. This is supported by the specific emission factors and component counts provided for different equipment and services, as well as the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. Additionally, the default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage further emphasize the need for separate emission reports. The emission factors and survey methods outlined in the data tables also reinforce the requirement for distinct reporting by each operator.",2,0.198757764,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear and concise response to the question. It cites the relevant regulations and provides supporting evidence from the provided data tables to emphasize the need for separate emission reports by each operator. The answer is well-structured and all sentences fit together naturally, making it easy to understand and follow.",909,,
96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"Natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment because the entire process of underground storage, including compression, is considered as a single unit for emissions reporting. This is due to the integral nature of processes such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement in underground natural gas storage facilities. As a result, the distinction between compressor and non-compressor components is not made in the emission factor calculation for underground natural gas storage facilities. The emission factor tables provide detailed population emission factors for various components and equipment in different service categories and material types, but they do not differentiate between compressor and non-compressor components for underground natural gas storage facilities.","The reason natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment is because the underground natural gas storage facilities, as defined, involve processes and operations such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, which are integral to the storage process. This means that the entire process of underground storage, including compression, is considered as a single unit for emissions reporting. Therefore, the distinction between compressor and non-compressor components is not made in the emission factor calculation for underground natural gas storage facilities.{

97,Does Subpart W require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility or does reporting start only when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage?,"Yes, Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility. The reporting includes CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources such as degasification systems, natural gas processing, storage tanks vented emissions, and injection of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery. Additionally, the emission factors and component counts provided in the tables can be used to quantify and report emissions from different equipment and processes involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting, as well as crude oil production equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions.","Yes, Subpart W requires reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility.

T = Average estimated number of hours in the operating year the pumps were operational using engineering estimates based on best available data. Default is 8,760 hours. The following assumptions will be made to complete the calculation: 1) T will be the default value 86 hours. 2) The concentration of GHGi is 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2. EF for High Continuous Bleed Pneumatic Device Vents is 37.3 scf/hour/component. Your pneumatic device emissions would be 31,041,060 scf CH4 which is calculated as 100 * 37.3 scf / hr / device * 0.95 * 8760 hours and 326,748 scf CO2 which is calculated as 100 * 37.3 scf / hr / device * 0.01 * 8760 hours.""

99,How should we report a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recoveray and storage?,"A facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for enhanced oil recovery and storage should report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flares. The facility must also report the quantities specified for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. To comply with the reporting requirements, the facility should consider the population emission factors for all components, gathering pipelines, and major equipment in both the Eastern and Western U.S. It should also take into account the whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression. By incorporating these factors into their reporting, the facility can ensure compliance with the necessary emission reporting standards.","Based on the provided information, a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for enhanced oil recovery and storage should report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flares. The facility must also report the quantities specified for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. Therefore, the facility should comply with the reporting requirements for emissions from the mentioned activities.{

}","What constitutes a facility, how to determine the reporting threshold, and reporting of emissions from collocated and dual purpose equipment is as follows: 1) As a first step the reporter must determine the emissions from all equipment listed in 98.232(c) for onshore petroleum and production.  Per section 98.231(a) only sources listed in 98.232(c) need to be considered for threshold determination for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. 98.238 defines “facility” for the purposes of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems.  Per the requirements of 98.3 each “facility” must submit a GHG report for all source categories at that “facility”.  2) Note that while identifying onshore production emissions sources reporters have to determine whether the source is “on the well pad or associated with a well pad”.  The location of production wells within other facilities is inconsequential to this determination.  Sources on a well pad or associated with a well pad across the entire reporting basin have to be taken into consideration.  If your emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production are equal to or greater than 25,000mtCO2e, then onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities report as a separate facility and include all emissions sources listed in 98.232(c).  3) Except for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution, which have unique facility definitions, all other segments subject to subpart W are considered in the threshold determination for a single facility.  You would also include emissions from other source categories at your facility (e.g., stationary combustion).  If there are emissions sources that are dual purpose then the rule requires this piece of equipment to be reported under the majority use industry segment based on guidance provided in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (pp. 1606-1608).  4) For collocated industry segments, which cannot occur in the case of onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution due to the requirements in 98.231(a), EPA has provided guidance on emissions reporting in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14.  Based on the information provided, the facility cannot be reported as onshore production and natural gas processing combined (see point 1 above).  For all the other segments, the report should use guidance in points 2-3 above to determine the segment under which the facility should be categorized.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate summary of the reporting requirements for a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for enhanced oil recovery and storage. It mentions all the necessary emission factors and specifies that the facility should report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flares. The answer also correctly identifies the quantities that the facility must report for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. Overall, the answer addresses all the important aspects of the question and provides a complete and relevant response.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the reporting requirements for a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for enhanced oil recovery and storage. It mentions the specific emissions that need to be reported, as well as the quantities specified for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. It also correctly identifies the various emission factors that the facility should consider in order to comply with the reporting requirements.",1,0.2832618026,2,The answer attempts to address the question but conveys some uncertainty by using words like 'should' and 'consider'.,4,The answer is mostly coherent as it provides clear and relevant information on the reporting requirements for a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for enhanced oil recovery and storage. The answer covers all the necessary emission factors and specifies the quantities that need to be reported for compliance with the emission reporting standards.,960,,
100,Are dehydration units that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility?,"Yes, dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility. This is supported by the text analysis which specifies that underground natural gas storage includes processes such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, excluding transmission pipelines. Additionally, wellheads connected to compression units located at the facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs are part of the definition. The table analysis provides additional context by presenting emission factors and component counts for various equipment involved in onshore natural gas production and gathering. While the formula analysis did not provide any relevant equations for this specific inquiry.","Yes, dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility.

108,"For a liquefied natural gas import facility, do boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported?","Based on the information provided, boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported. The text analysis outlines the requirement to report intentional or designed releases of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas or hydrocarbon gas, including process designed flow to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes, equipment blowdown for maintenance, and direct venting of gas used to power equipment, such as pneumatic devices. Additionally, the calculation methods specified in the content further emphasize the need for reporting emissions from LNG storage facilities. The table analysis provides emission factors and population emission factors for various components and services related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and compression, including specific factors for LNG storage and methane leaker emission factors. This data further supports the need to report boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank.","Yes, boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported.

109,Are natural gas distribution facilities required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulator(s) under §98.232(i )?,"Based on the text analysis, it is clear that natural gas distribution facilities without above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations are not required to calculate emissions for above grade metering-regulating stations and are not required to report GHG emissions under § 98.232(i)(2)(B). Therefore, they are not required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulators under §98.232(i). Additionally, the table analysis provides detailed information on emission factors, component counts, and survey methods related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, and storage. The equations and explanations specify the factors and conversions used in calculating emissions, such as fuel mass or volume, high heat value, CO2 emission factors, and conversion factors. This comprehensive information supports the conclusion drawn from the text analysis regarding the reporting requirements for natural gas distribution facilities.","Natural gas distribution facilities that do not have above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations are not required to calculate emissions for above grade metering-regulating stations and are not required to report GHG emissions under § 98.232(i)(2)(B).

If multiple complete leak detection surveys are conducted in a calendar year, the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions. Facilities must indicate the number of years in the leak survey cycle if performing equipment leak surveys across a multiple year cycle, not exceeding a five year period. Therefore, a facility must conduct at least one leak detection survey in a calendar year, and the facility must indicate the number of years in the leak survey cycle if conducting surveys across multiple years, not exceeding a five year period. The population emission factors for various components in the Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, along with the default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment. Additionally, the default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as the default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground gas storage are available for reference.","At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year.

The answer also provides additional information on population emission factors and average component counts for various equipment types, as well as default emission factors for different stages of natural gas production and storage.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year. If multiple surveys are conducted, the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions. Additionally, facilities must indicate the number of years in the leak survey cycle if conducting surveys across multiple years, not exceeding a five year period. The answer is logically consistent with the information provided in the context.",1,0.3438256659,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the number of leak detection surveys that must be conducted in a calendar year and the requirement for facilities to indicate the number of years in the leak survey cycle if conducting surveys across multiple years.

112,"Would a monitoring plan that results in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4 and 20% in year five, be consistent with the rule language of ""approximately equal across all years in the cycle.""",No answer found,No context found,"As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question. It does not provide any information related to the monitoring plan or the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.',1,The answer is not possible to determine whether it is true or false without further information as there is no context provided and the answer is 'No answer found'.,1,0.0,5,"The answer straightforwardly states that no answer was found, which aligns with the criteria for a five-star rating.",2,The answer mostly lacks coherence. The answer does not provide any information or explanation about the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle' and how the given monitoring plan is or is not consistent with it.

}","With regards to acid gas injection wells and subparts PP and UU, please see the response to EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-0582-31 in the Response to Comments (pages 1474 - 1476) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf.  EPA requires reporters to calculate emissions from AGR units and then adjust them downwards by the amount transferred outside of the facility.  Therefore, if 100% of the CO2 recovered from an AGR unit is transferred outside of the facility, then CO2 emissions from the AGR unit must be calculated prior to determining the amount being transferred outside the facility.  Note that §98.236(c)(3) requires separate reporting of both the AGR emissions and emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility, even if the values are the same.",5,"The answer fully addresses the main aspects of the question and provides additional relevant information about the regulatory compliance and emission reduction efforts. The answer correctly states that the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero, even if all of the CO2 emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside of the facility. The answer also mentions the default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, as well as average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, which are relevant to the question and provide additional context.",5,"The answer directly states that even if all CO2 emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero. This information logically follows from the context provided.",3,0.3794871795,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent and provides relevant information about the requirement to calculate emissions and reduce them to zero, even if the emissions are recovered and transferred outside the facility. The answer also mentions the availability of default whole gas emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, which can be used for regulatory compliance and emission reduction efforts.",706,,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"Facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. The annual quantity of CO2 emissions from the acid gas removal unit that were recovered and transferred outside the facility must be reported in metric tons CO2 under subpart PP of this part. Additionally, the default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and the average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment are provided in the tables for further reference in emission estimation and reporting.","Yes, facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.

121,For AGR vents is the use of a meter to measure flow rates required?,"For AGR vents, the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required for calculating emissions for CO2, as described in the regulations. The calculation methods in paragraph (d) should be followed, and if a continuous gas analyzer is not available, quarterly gas samples from the vent gas stream should be taken to determine the flow rates for each quarter of AGR unit operation. Additionally, the provided tables offer emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. The data includes population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and population emission factors for various components and services. These tables can be referenced for understanding the emission factors and counts associated with different equipment and services in the Eastern and Western U.S., as well as for natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage.","For AGR vents, the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required for calculating emissions for CO2, as described in the provided regulations. The calculation methods described in the paragraph (d) should be followed, and if a continuous gas analyzer is not available, quarterly gas samples from the vent gas stream should be taken to determine the flow rates for each quarter that the AGR unit is operating. Therefore, yes, the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required for AGR vents.{

122,For which units of measure are we required to calculate and report emissions using Equation W-3? May we use a flow meter to calculate annual emission CO2?,"Equation W-3 specifies the use of a vent meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions. However, based on the guidelines provided in the text analysis, it is permissible to use a flow meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions. The table analysis provides detailed population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. It also includes the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states and default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression. While the formula analysis did not yield relevant information, the combined text and table analysis support the use of a flow meter for calculating annual CO2 emissions despite the specification in Equation W-3.","Equation W-3 specifies the use of a vent meter to calculate annual emission CO2. Therefore, you may use a flow meter to calculate annual emission CO2 as per the guidelines provided in the text.{

However, §98.233(d)(10) requires that the volumetric emissions of equation W-3 be converted into mass emissions using §98.233(v)’s methods.  You must report emissions in metric tons of CO2e to meet the reporting requirements in §98.236(c)(3)(v).  If reporters use the methodology set forth in §98.233(d)(2), then a vent flow meter must be used to determine the total annual volume of vent gas flowing out of the AGR unit.",4,"The answer provides relevant information about Equation W-3 and the use of a flow meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions. It also includes additional information from the table analysis that supports the use of a flow meter despite the specification in Equation W-3. However, the answer does not fully address the question as it does not explicitly state the units of measure for reporting emissions using Equation W-3.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context. The answer provides a clear explanation that Equation W-3 specifies the use of a vent meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions, but it is permissible to use a flow meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions based on the guidelines provided in the text analysis. The answer also provides additional information from the table analysis, which supports the use of a flow meter for calculating annual CO2 emissions despite the specification in Equation W-3.",1,0.2486486486,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent and provides relevant information about the use of a flow meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions, despite the specification in Equation W-3. The answer also includes supporting details from the table analysis, such as population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering.",814,,
123,For blowdown vent stacks does the 98.233.i reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume refer to a gas volume or a physical container volume?,"The reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks pertains to the physical container volume. Equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section. This is further supported by the analysis of emission factors and component counts for major equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. The tables provide detailed information on emission factors for various components, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves, which are relevant to the physical container volume and its impact on emissions.","The reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume in the context of blowdown vent stacks pertains to the physical container volume.

The regulations allow for combined volumetric emissions from manifolded groups of compressor sources to be measured at the common vent stack, with specific measurement methods and frequencies outlined in the regulations. This approval is in line with the specified measurement and monitoring requirements for manifolded compressor sources. In addition, the default whole gas emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment are provided for both Eastern and Western U.S., offering valuable insights into the emission factors and component counts relevant to the approval. The emission factors for leaker components, including valves, flanges, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and others, are also detailed, further supporting the approval decision. The population emission factors for various components in onshore natural gas transmission compression and underground natural gas storage, along with methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage, provide comprehensive data for evaluating emissions. Overall, the approval aligns with the available emission factor and component count data, ensuring compliance with the monitoring and measurement requirements.","Based on the information provided, EPA approves the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold.

129,Do dehydrators which are used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator?,"Yes, dehydrators which are used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator as per the information provided in the text. The text specifies the use of liquid absorbents such as desiccants like activated alumina, pelletized calcium chloride, lithium chloride, and granular silica gel material in dehydrators to remove water from raw natural gas. It also mentions the absorption of water vapor from a natural gas stream, which aligns with the definition of a dehydrator. Therefore, based on the information provided, dehydrators used to dry a liquid stream do meet the definition of dehydrator. Additionally, the tables provide data on average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, which further supports the use of dehydrators in the context of gas and oil production operations.","Yes, dehydrators which are used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator as per the information provided in the text.

}","However, for the 2011 reporting year onwards, you must include flare stack emissions in the applicability determination, as flares are included under subpart W.Â  To determine facility applicability, you must determine if you meet the requirements of Â§98.2(a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3).Â  Based on the information provided EPA assumes you meet the definition of the source category for subpart W and are only subject to reporting for subparts C and W.",5,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the inclusion of flare emissions in the combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a). It also mentions the calculation of annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions resulting from flaring gas, which are essential components of the combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources. Additionally, the answer provides detailed emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting equipment, as well as default whole gas leaker emission factors. The formula analysis includes various conversion factors and constants relevant to emission calculations, such as molar volume conversion, molecular weight ratios, and unit conversions, which are essential for accurate emissions assessments and reporting.

","Under §98.232(e), emissions from flare stacks are not required to be reported as a separate emission source for onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities.  However, this does not exclude the reporting of flared emissions from the other emission sources listed in §98.232(e) if they are routed to a flare.  The flare source type in §98.233(n) covers only emissions that are not reported in association with any of the other source types in §98.233; see §98.233(n)(10).  For example, if transmission storage tank emissions are going to a flare, then the rule requires the adjustment of transmission storage tank emissions sent to flare per §98.233(k)(4).  The flared transmission storage tank emissions, however, have to be reported as transmission storage tank emissions under §98.236(c)(9).",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, addressing the specific section of the environmental regulations that provides guidance on emissions from flares, as well as additional information on related data such as default emission factors and component counts for natural gas and crude oil production, storage, and transmission facilities.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, citing section 98.233 as the relevant guidance for emissions from flares and explaining the methodology and requirements provided in that section.
