0,Who is required to report under subpart W?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emission from the data. The equation describes E = COUNT * EF, where E represents the emissions, COUNT is the number of units, and EF is the emission factor. The extraction explains that the reporting requirements under subpart W apply to owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHGs, as well as to certain suppliers. It also outlines the conditions for discontinuing compliance based on reported emissions, reporting schedules and requirements for new facilities, changes in operations, and facility mergers, reporting alternatives for units using the four Tiers, and details on the certification and submission of GHG emissions reports. Additionally, it includes special provisions for best available monitoring methods and revised global warming potentials for reporting years 2013 and subsequent years.","Subpart W establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that directly emit GHG as well as for certain suppliers. Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and all applicable subparts of this part. For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and Operator used in subpart A have the same definition as Onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator. The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf and that meets the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources only for facilities that meet all three conditions listed in paragraph (a)(3). If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator. Similar provisions exist for reported emissions less than 15,000 metric tons CO2e per year for three consecutive years.

How do you calculate emissions from leaking components if onshore petroleum and natural gas source are not required to monitor components?,"The emissions factors listed in Table W-1A are used to calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year emission threshold. The table provides emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, including different regions and services such as gas, light crude, and heavy crude. These emission factors are essential for calculating emissions from leaking components, as they represent the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of activity. For example, the emission factor for a valve in the Eastern U.S. Gas Service is 0.027, which means that for every unit of valve activity, 0.027 metric tons of CO2e are emitted. Similarly, the emission factors for other components and services in different regions provide the necessary data for calculating emissions from leaking components. If onshore petroleum and natural gas sources are not required to monitor components, the emissions from leaking components can be calculated using the equation E = COUNT * EF, where E is the total emissions, COUNT is the number of units, and EF is the emission factor. This equation allows for the estimation of emissions even when monitoring of components is not required, by multiplying the number of units with the corresponding emission factor.

78,What is the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often must a facility re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold?,"The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is derived from a set of conditions that the facility must meet, including the aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units, the annual emissions of CO2e from all stationary fuel combustion sources, and the requirement to re-evaluate the threshold whenever there is a change that could affect its applicability. The provided input also includes various tables such as Table W-1A, W-1B, W-1C, W-1D, W-1E, W-2, W-3A, W-3B, and W-4A, which offer default emission factors, component counts, and state designations for different equipment and processes in the petroleum and natural gas industry. These tables provide valuable data for calculating emissions and understanding the environmental impact of gas processing facilities. Additionally, the input contains a mix of LaTeX equations and text, which are used to represent environmental parameters and calculations related to emissions from different processes. The equations include variables and symbols such as E, EF, CO2, HHV, N2O, P, and others, which are used to quantify emissions of various gases and substances. The equations and their explanations are crucial for understanding the emission calculation methods and the factors involved in determining the environmental impact of gas processing facilities.","The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is that a facility must meet three conditions: the aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or greater, the facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources, and the facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold whenever there is any change that could cause it to meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.","However, please note that if, in year 2, your throughput capacity is less than 25 MMscf per day, you are not required to calculate and report GHG emissions from gas processing in year 2.  You would still be required to report other covered emissions at your facility.  This is because gas processing would not be an applicable segment for year 2.  Nevertheless, your facility would still be required to report in year 2, even if facility-wide emissions are less than 25,000mt CO2e, and would continue to report until you meet the criteria in 98.2(i) for ceasing to report.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.  This throughput is re-evaluated annually.  Once you are subject to the rule (e.g., your facility contains a source category listed in Table A-4), your facility must continue complying with all the requirements of this part, even if the facility does not meet the applicability requirements in a future year (i.e., 25,000 mtCO2e for petroleum and natural gas systems). The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate response to the question, addressing all the main aspects of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often a facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold.
