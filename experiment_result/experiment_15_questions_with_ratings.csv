}","Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year must report. The rule defines three different types of facilities. You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the facilities that are required to report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems), including the reporting requirements and the use of specific calculation methods and tables for estimating emissions.

8,What gases must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities?,"The document provides detailed information on the gases that must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities, including CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. It also outlines the reporting requirements for various equipment such as compressors, generators, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares. Additionally, it includes population emission factors, default average component counts, and various equations for calculating emissions. The tables provide specific emission factors for different components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions, along with default population emission factors for various processes such as natural gas processing, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression. The provided equations and conversion factors are essential for calculating emissions from the given data.","The gases that must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities include CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions.

","Under this rule, facilities will detect, as applicable, and calculate GHG emissions according to the specified quantification methods. See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of how to calculate greenhouse gas emissions for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities.

If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",5,"The answer provides a direct and accurate response to the question, citing the specific information provided in the text about the timeline for reporting for subpart W. It addresses all important aspects of the question and is therefore given a rating of five stars.",5,The answer is a direct quote from the context and provides the exact information requested in the question.,2,0.2436548223,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear and direct response to the question by stating that the reporting for subpart W begins with the submission of complete reporting year 2011, 2012, and 2013 GHG reports by March 31, 2015. The answer is well-structured and all sentences fit together naturally, making it easy to understand and follow.",247,,
12,Is there any way we can get unlocked subpart W screening spreadsheets from the applicability tool?,"The document mentions that facilities subject to subpart W may use best engineering estimates for data related to newly acquired sources for the first 6 months of required data collection. It also specifies the method for determining the number of sources of equipment type t with screening values greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7. Additionally, the document provides various tables containing population emission factors, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, default methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, and default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for underground natural gas storage.

13,The applicability tool for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas has an operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons. How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The text provides detailed information about onshore petroleum and natural gas production, including the definition of equipment, owner/operator responsibilities, and reporting requirements. It also mentions the reporting of emissions from various equipment types and the calculation methods for CO2, CH4, and N2O combustion-related emissions. However, it does not directly address the correlation between the operating factor for associated gas venting and the barrels of crude oil produced. The tables provided include population emission factors for different components, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. These tables contain valuable data that can be used to calculate emissions and understand the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production. However, the specific correlation between the operating factor for associated gas venting and the barrels of crude oil produced is not explicitly addressed in the given text.","The text provides detailed information about onshore petroleum and natural gas production, including the definition of equipment, owner/operator responsibilities, and reporting requirements.

14,Where can I find the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"The document provides detailed information on the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. It mentions the need to analyze a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category or county for oil composition and Reid vapor pressure using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization. Additionally, it outlines the calculation of gas to oil ratio (GOR) for hydrocarbon production from oil wells and the determination of production rate from gas wells. The document also provides guidance on the best available monitoring methods for measurement data for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, as well as the use of default whole gas leaker factors for components in gas service. It emphasizes the importance of quality assurance for GHG emissions data and provides specific calculation methods for estimating CH4 and CO2 emissions from production storage tanks. Furthermore, it outlines requirements for reporting component type, service type, and geographic location for onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities. Additionally, the document includes several tables with default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions, which can be used for estimating emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.","The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production can be found by analyzing a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil in each sub-basin category or county for oil composition and Reid vapor pressure using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization.

These tables contain emission factors for different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meters, instruments, and others, and specify different values for the two different survey methods (method 1 and method 2). The emission factors for each component are different for the two types of facilities, leading to the difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage.","The units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting differ between transmission compression and underground storage due to the different default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors specified in the subpart tables for these two types of facilities.{

It also mentions the specific tables that contain the default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for these two types of facilities, and explains how the emission factors for different components are different for the two types of facilities, leading to the difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage. Therefore, the answer has perfect relevance to the given question and context.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting differ between transmission compression and underground storage. It references the different default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors specified in the subpart tables for these two types of facilities, and explains how these factors vary for different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meters, instruments, and others, leading to the difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage. The answer also correctly identifies the tables where these emission factors are provided, and notes that they specify different values for the two different survey methods (method 1 and method 2).

It mentions the reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary combustion units under subpart C, which is relevant to the question. The equations provided include the fuel mass or volume, high heat value, CO2 emission factor, annual CO2 mass emissions, and natural gas usage, among others. Additionally, the document contains tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions. However, it does not explicitly state the specific date by which the monitoring plan should have been put in place for facilities subject to 40 CFR part 98 due to subpart W related emissions. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact date for the monitoring plan to be put in place.","Based on the information provided, the monitoring plan for a facility that operates stationary combustion equipment and only became subject to 40 CFR part 98 due to subpart W related emissions should have been put in place by January 1, 2011. This is because the text mentions reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary combustion units under subpart C, and it provides detailed instructions for calculating and reporting these emissions under the specified subpart.{

These equations and tables are used for calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum and natural gas facilities. The equations provide conversion factors, emission factors, and calculation methods for different components and equipment, while the tables provide default values for emission factors and component counts in different regions of the U.S. Therefore, the document contains detailed information on the calculation methods and default values for reporting greenhouse gas emissions, but it does not mention a specific PowerPoint presentation.","The document contains information about the reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas facilities under the GHG reporting rule.

Therefore, emissions from external combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu per hour do not need to be included in the 25,000 metric ton threshold determination. The provided input does not contain any specific calculation methods or formulas related to the determination of emissions from external combustion sources. However, it does include tables with population emission factors for various components and equipment in different locations, which could be used in emissions calculations for specific scenarios. The emission factors provided in the tables can be used in conjunction with the counts of components to estimate emissions from different equipment and locations.","The document specifies that external fuel combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu/hr do not need to report combustion emissions or include these emissions for threshold determination.

}","Actual temperature and pressure as defined for §98.233 is the “average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions.”  Therefore, the average temperature and pressure at a given location based on annual averages can be used for actual temperature and actual pressure.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on how to convert actual temperature and pressure readings to standard conditions, but it does not directly define actual temperature and pressure for an annual average. However, the answer does provide additional relevant information on population emission factors for different components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment in different regions.",5,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of how actual temperature and pressure are defined for an annual average. It mentions the use of mathematical correlations to convert temperature and pressure readings to actual values and then correct measured flow rates to standard conditions. It also emphasizes the importance of calibrating and maintaining temperature and pressure monitors, and refers to various consensus-based standards organizations for measurement methods. Additionally, it provides tables with population emission factors for different components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment in different regions. Overall, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context and provides a comprehensive guide for handling temperature and pressure measurements in the context of environmental regulations.",1,0.1818181818,1,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of how to convert measured volumes of CO2 and natural gas to standard industry temperature and pressure conditions, and outlines the use of mathematical correlations to convert temperature and pressure readings to actual values and then correct measured flow rates to standard conditions.

22,Should self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W?,"The document mentioned that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W, as they are integral to the extraction, processing, or movement of oil or natural gas and are located at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities as defined in § 98.238. Additionally, the document provides specific equations and methods for calculating annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing, as well as the reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various equipment and operations. The document also includes several tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and natural gas transmission compression. These tables can be used to calculate the GHG emissions from different components and equipment. Therefore, based on the information provided, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W.","Based on the information provided, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W, as they are integral to the extraction, processing, or movement of oil or natural gas and are located at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities as defined in § 98.238.

The answer also correctly concludes that based on this information, self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It explicitly states that self-propelled workover equipment and truck loading and unloading should be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W, as they are integral to the extraction, processing, or movement of oil or natural gas and are located at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities as defined in § 98.238. The document also provides specific equations and methods for calculating annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing, as well as the reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various equipment and operations. The document also includes several tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and natural gas transmission compression. These tables can be used to calculate the GHG emissions from different components and equipment.",2,0.1603375527,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the document's information, including specific equations and methods for calculating emissions and reporting requirements. It also mentions the tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major equipment, which can be used to calculate GHG emissions.

23,How do I define a facility under subpart W? Are all industry segments included in one annual GHG report?,"A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. The definition of a facility varies for different industry segments such as electric power system, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, petrochemical plants, refineries, natural gas distribution, and carbon dioxide production wells. Each industry segment has its own specific criteria for defining a facility. Not all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report, as each industry segment has its own reporting requirements.","A facility under subpart W is defined as any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas.

}","An onshore production facility is defined in 40 CFR 98.238 and will report only those emissions from the emissions sources listed in 40 CFR 98.232.  The onshore production facility has a single designated representative and does not include other industry segments or other source categories in its annual GHG report.  Similarly, if a facility meets the definition for natural gas distribution that facility reports only what’s listed in 98.232(i).  All other industry segments under subpart W use the definition of facility in subpart A and report emissions in a single annual GHG report.  Each facility must have one and only one designated representative.  But, the same DR could represent multiple facilities.  Other than onshore production and natural gas distribution, it is possible for a single facility to report under multiple industry segments.  Please see requirements in 98.231(a) and response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 in the EPA’s final Response to Public Comments Document for subpart W.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate definition of a facility under subpart W, including the different industry segments and their specific criteria for defining a facility.

24,What emissions are reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities?,"The document provides information on annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from venting gas directly to the atmosphere, as well as emissions from production and transformation processes. It also mentions the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) for quantifying CO2 mass emissions and the calculation methods for various emissions. Additionally, it discusses the inclusion of captured CO2 for transfer off site in the emissions calculation. The document also includes several tables providing default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage. These tables contain specific emission factors for different components and services, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components, as well as population emission factors for different pneumatic device vents. The tables also provide information on the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. The document does not explicitly mention the emissions reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities, but it provides relevant emission factors and calculation methods that can be used to derive the emissions from these facilities.","The document provides information on annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from venting gas directly to the atmosphere, as well as emissions from production and transformation processes.

}","EPA does not have an exact estimate of what percent of U.S. emissions are covered under petroleum and natural gas systems at this time.  The petroleum and natural gas systems source category (Subpart W) requires reporting from facilities above an emissions threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e.  It is difficult to quantify what net emissions occurr below the threshold.  In addition, facilities below the threshold may not be directly comparable to facilities over the emission threshold due to differences in the types of emission sources covered.  EPA will continue to analyze the emissions from reports as well as linking the information to the US GHG Inventory to identify what fraction of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are covered by the GHGRP.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question.

28,"How does EPA define a ""facility"" for petroleum and natural gas systems?","EPA defines a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or common control, including leased, rented, or contracted activities by an onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator and that are located in a single hydrocarbon basin. It includes gathering pipelines, separators, compressors, acid gas removal units, dehydrators, pneumatic devices/pumps, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares. Gathering and boosting system means a single network of pipelines, compressors, and process equipment, including equipment to perform natural gas compression, dehydration, and acid gas removal, that has one or more connection points to gas and oil production and a downstream endpoint, typically a gas processing plant, transmission pipeline, LDC pipeline, or other gathering and boosting system. The document also provides various equations and tables related to emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for different equipment and services in the petroleum and natural gas industry.","EPA defines a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or common control, including leased, rented, or contracted activities by an onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator and that are located in a single hydrocarbon basin.

It specifies the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for offshore and onshore facilities, as well as the calculation methods to be used for different equipment types and geographic locations. It also outlines the specific emission source types and thresholds for reporting, such as the requirement to report emissions if certain equipment emits 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Additionally, it mentions the reporting of annual quantities of petroleum products and natural gas liquids, as well as the need to retain laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used for estimating CO2 emissions.

}","For the “Liquefied Natural Gas Storage” calculation utility, the spreadsheet multiplies Population Counts, Emission Factors, and conversion factors to output methane emissions in tonnes CO2e for each source.Final CO2e emissions = (Population Count) x (Emission Factors) x (Volume conversion)",3,"The answer partially addresses the main aspects of the question by mentioning that the document provides information on the calculation of CO2e emissions for LNG storage facilities, including the use of Equation NN-5a and default CO2 emission factors from Table NN-2.

The tables also include default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and methane leaker emission factors for various equipment and services related to natural gas production, transmission, storage, and LNG storage. These tables and equations outline the methodologies specified in 40 CFR Part 98 Subpart C for quantifying and reporting emissions from stationary sources of fuel combustion.","Emissions from stationary sources of fuel combustion are to be quantified and reported in accordance with the methodologies specified in 40 CFR Part 98 Subpart C, as described in the provided text. The text mentions the calculation of annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in metric tons using specific calculation methodologies specified in § 98.33(a) and § 98.33(c). It also specifies the exclusion of carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass, but inclusion of emissions of CH4 and N2O from biomass combustion. Additionally, it outlines reporting requirements for different types of stationary fuel combustion sources, such as boilers, turbines, engines, and incinerators, and provides guidance on reporting emissions from specific processes like ammonia manufacturing and hydrogen production. The text also mentions the conditions for reporting under subpart C and the calculation and reporting of emissions from flares.

The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",,,5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. The context specifies that an offshore facility that emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources based on GOADS calculation methodology and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011. The document also provides detailed information on the reporting requirements for different types of facilities, including offshore production facilities, and the emission reporting thresholds for different industry segments. Additionally, the document contains tables with default emission factors and component counts for different types of equipment, which can be used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions from the offshore facility.",4,0.2283464567,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise response to the question. It references the provided information and explains that the offshore facility would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011. It also mentions the reporting requirements and provides additional details on how to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions using the default emission factors and component counts provided in the document.,628,,
47,"Can we use 2011 BOEMRE data, rather than the previously available data from 2008, for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility?","The document mentioned several calculation methods and emission factors for different components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. It provides equations for calculating emissions of various greenhouse gases and specifies emission factors for different components. However, there is no specific mention of 2011 BOEMRE data or its suitability for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is unclear whether the 2011 BOEMRE data can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from the mentioned facility.","The document mentions provisions for estimating 2011 and subsequent year emissions, including the submission of complete reports for 2011, 2012, and 2013 by March 31, 2015. It also discusses the calculation of CO2e using specific GWPs and the reporting of emissions using scoping speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations developed after certain dates. There are also references to reporting requirements for semiconductor manufacturing facilities and conditions for discontinuing compliance based on emission levels. However, there is no specific mention of 2011 BOEMRE data, so it's unclear whether it can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility.{

It provides equations for calculating emissions of various greenhouse gases and specifies emission factors for different components. However, there is no specific mention of 2011 BOEMRE data or its suitability for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is unclear whether the 2011 BOEMRE data can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from the mentioned facility.",2,0.1739130435,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.

48,"If an offshore oil and gas production platform or facility is farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, does that facility have to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C?","The document provides information about reporting emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, including the requirement to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for offshore production. It also specifies that offshore platforms do not need to report portable emissions. Additionally, it mentions that offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction should report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in a data collection and emissions estimation study. However, it does not explicitly state whether a facility located farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, has to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C. The provided tables contain emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as leaker emission factors for different survey methods. However, there is no specific information or calculation provided in the document that directly addresses the question about reporting emissions data to EPA for Subpart C based on the location of the facility in relation to the limit of state waters defined by the Submerged Lands Act.","The document provides information about reporting emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, including the requirement to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for offshore production.

",Please note that amendments were made in November 2010 (75 FR 74487) to extend applicability of the GHG Reporting Program to facilities “attached to or under the Outer Continental Shelf.”  Those same rule amendments amended the definition of United States.  (See p. 74488 in http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-28655.pdf.),2,"The answer mostly lacks relevance.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",2,0.1214953271,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the answer does not explicitly state whether a facility located farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, has to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C, it provides information about reporting emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and mentions that offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction should report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in a data collection and emissions estimation study. Additionally, it provides emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, as well as leaker emission factors for different survey methods, which may be useful for further research.",3,"The answer is partially coherent. It provides information about reporting emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, including the requirement to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for offshore production. It also mentions that offshore platforms do not need to report portable emissions and that offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction should report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in a data collection and emissions estimation study. However, it does not directly address the question about reporting emissions data to EPA for Subpart C based on the location of the facility in relation to the limit of state waters defined by the Submerged Lands Act.",1226,,
49,By when do onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report?,"The document provides information about the reporting requirements for onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W. It mentions that onshore facilities must report emissions from specific source types such as compressors, storage tanks, and gathering pipelines, while offshore facilities must follow the monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE. Additionally, there are specific emission thresholds that determine whether reporting is required for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. The document also includes tables with data on population emission factors, default average component counts for major equipment, and default total hydrocarbon emission factors for various equipment and services. However, there are no specific dates mentioned in the text regarding when the reporting needs to be done.","Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report their emissions from various equipment and activities associated with petroleum and natural gas production. The reporting includes information on CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, as well as the use of calculation methods and default emission factors specified in the regulations. Onshore facilities must report emissions from specific source types, such as compressors, storage tanks, and gathering pipelines, while offshore facilities must follow the monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE. The reporting requirements also consider the ownership or control of equipment and facilities within a single hydrocarbon basin. Additionally, there are specific emission thresholds that determine whether reporting is required for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities.{

For example, the document provides population emission factors for different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, etc., which can be used in the calculation of emissions. Additionally, the document also specifies the designation of Eastern and Western U.S., which can be used to determine the appropriate factors based on the location of the offshore facilities.

52,Are the emissions factors listed in Table W-1A for both leaking components and non-leaking components? How do you calculate emissions from leaking components if onshore petroleum and natural gas source are not required to monitor components?,"The document provides information on the development of site-specific emissions factors for petroleum products and natural gas liquids. It outlines two calculation methods for determining emission factors and specifies the conditions under which emission testing and separate emission factors are required. It also mentions the calculation of fossil fuel-based CO2 emissions and the development of adjusted process-vent-specific emission factors for different operating scenarios. Additionally, the document contains tables that list default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. These tables provide population emission factors for various components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions. Furthermore, there is a separate table that presents default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. This table includes leaker emission factors for different components under different survey methods. However, the document does not explicitly mention the calculation of emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources. It is important to note that the emission factors listed in Table W-1A are for both non-leaking and leaking components, and the calculation of emissions from leaking components may require additional information or specific methodologies not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.","The document provides information on the development of site-specific emissions factors for petroleum products and natural gas liquids.

}","Equipment leak emissions in onshore production are to be estimated using methods provided in 98.233(r)(2).  Hence, no leak detection of emissions is required for onshore production.  Table W-1A provides population emission factors, which represent the emissions on an average from the entire population of components – both leaking and non-leaking; please see section 6(d) of the Technical Support Document (http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_TSD.pdf) for further details on the concept of population emission factors.",2,"The answer does not address the main aspects of the question, which is about whether the emissions factors listed in Table W-1A are for both leaking and non-leaking components, and how to calculate emissions from leaking components if monitoring is not required. Instead, the answer provides a general overview of the document, including the development of emission factors, the calculation of CO2 emissions, and the tables that list default whole gas emission factors and leaker emission factors. While the answer does mention that the emission factors listed in Table W-1A are for both non-leaking and leaking components, it does not provide a clear explanation of how to calculate emissions from leaking components. Therefore, the answer mostly lacks relevance to the question.",1,"The provided answer does not directly answer the question asked. It provides information about the emission factors listed in the document, but does not explicitly state whether the emission factors listed in Table W-1A are for both leaking and non-leaking components. Additionally, the answer acknowledges that the document does not explicitly mention the calculation of emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources, but does not provide a clear answer to the question asked.",3,0.288973384,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear and concise summary of the information provided in the document, including the tables that list default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, as well as the separate table that presents default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. The answer also correctly notes that the emission factors listed in Table W-1A are for both non-leaking and leaking components, and acknowledges that the calculation of emissions from leaking components may require additional information or specific methodologies not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

57,"For combustion equipment that triggered Subpart C reporting, can this be incorporated into Subpart W reporting for CY2011, or will there be 2 separate (Subpart C and Subpart W) reporting schema?","The document provides information about the reporting requirements for combustion equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities, including the maximum rated heat input capacity. It also discusses the reporting of emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment at these facilities under subpart W. However, there is no explicit indication of whether the combustion equipment triggering Subpart C reporting can be incorporated into Subpart W reporting for CY2011 or if there will be 2 separate reporting schemas. The document also includes several equations and tables related to emission factors, fuel combustion, and population emission factors for different components and services. These equations and tables provide the necessary factors and values for calculating emissions, but they do not directly address the specific question about the incorporation of Subpart C reporting into Subpart W reporting.","The combustion equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities must report the information specified in paragraph (z) of the section. The combustion units subject to reporting according to paragraph (a)(1)(xviii), (a)(8)(i), or (a)(9)(xii) of this section must report the information specified in paragraphs (z)(1) and (2) of this section. It is mentioned that the combustion unit has a maximum rated heat input capacity of less than 30 mmBtu/hr. The document also discusses the reporting of emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities under subpart W.

These tables provide specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment and regions, which can be used in the calculation methods for GHG emissions. However, without explicit information on the need for changes when transitioning between subparts, further clarification may be required from the regulatory authority or additional documentation.","The text provides detailed definitions and requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas transmission compression, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas processing, and LNG storage.

59,"For an onshore natural gas production facility that was subject to subpart C for RY2010 and will be subject to subpart W for RY2011, do I report my basin emissions under the same facility registration I used for my RY2010 report?","The document provides detailed descriptions of various onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as the reporting requirements for different emission sources. It also specifies the calculation methods for GHG emissions from stationary or portable equipment. However, it does not explicitly address whether basin emissions should be reported under the same facility registration for different reporting years. The document also includes several tables providing default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and facilities, which can be used to calculate emissions. These tables can be used to derive the emission factors for different components and equipment, which can then be used in the emission calculation formulas provided in the document. The document mentioned several calculation methods, such as the use of different survey methods for deriving emission factors, as well as the use of specific equations for calculating emissions from different equipment components. However, it does not directly address the specific question about reporting basin emissions under the same facility registration for different reporting years.","The document provides detailed definitions and descriptions of onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas transmission compression, offshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas processing, and LNG storage. It also outlines the reporting requirements for various emission sources and specifies the calculation methods for GHG emissions from stationary or portable equipment. However, it does not explicitly address whether basin emissions should be reported under the same facility registration for different reporting years.{

While it provides some relevant information about the document and its contents, it does not directly address the specific question about reporting basin emissions under the same facility registration for different reporting years.

60,Are the results of Equations W-11A and W-11B in standard conditions or actual conditions?,"The document mentioned that the calculated flowback rates from Equations W-11A and W-11B are converted from actual conditions to standard conditions for use in Equations W–12A and W–12B. This indicates that the results of Equations W-11A and W-11B are initially in actual conditions and then converted to standard conditions for further use. Therefore, the results of Equations W-11A and W-11B are in actual conditions initially and then converted to standard conditions.","Equations W-11A and W-11B are used to calculate flowback rates for well completions and well workovers in each sub-basin and well type combination. The calculated flowback rates are then converted from actual conditions to standard conditions for use in Equations W–12A and W–12B. The document provides detailed procedures for calculating emissions from well venting during completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing, including the use of Equations W–10A and W–10B, and the determination of FRM<i>s</i> and FRM<i>i</i> values based on flow rates for flowback gases. It also specifies the number of measurements or calculations required to estimate FRM<i>s</i> and FRM<i>i</i> for different numbers of completions or workovers. Overall, the calculations and procedures described in the document are based on actual conditions and provide guidance for determining emissions in specific well and sub-basin combinations.{

}",Geologic provinces 160 (Appalachian Basin) and 160A (Appalachian Basin-Eastern Overthrust area) are two distinct basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production under Part 98.,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, stating that geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered as separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. The answer also provides additional relevant information from the document, including definitions and criteria for classifying sub-basins and basins, and information on population emission factors and default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. This additional information demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic and further supports the relevance of the answer to the question.",5,"The answer directly states that geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered as separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. The document provides definitions and criteria for classifying sub-basins and basins, and it specifies that all onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment associated with all wells in a basin would be considered one facility.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and regulate emissions from these facilities. This requirement ensures that emissions from all equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, including various types of equipment used in the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas, are properly monitored and reported. The reporting by basin also allows for the identification of common ownership or control of multiple wells in a basin, treating them as a single facility for reporting purposes. Additionally, the reporting requirement covers gathering and boosting equipment used to collect and transport petroleum and/or natural gas from onshore production gas or oil wells. The EPA also specifies the calculation methods and emission factors to be used for reporting, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the reported data. The provided tables contain emission factors for different components and materials used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, which are essential for calculating and reporting emissions accurately.","The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately track and regulate emissions from these facilities.

}","When the GHGRP requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production were proposed, EPA’s goal was to provide a facility definition that all producers could directly apply, and that would be both practical and cost-effective.  EPA sought public comment on a range of possible options for defining the facility that would report with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, ranging from defining the facility at the individual well pad, to defining the facility at the field-level, to defining the facility at the basin-level.  Taking into account public comment, EPA finalized the definition of facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production using a basin-level approach because the operational boundaries and basin demarcations are clearly defined and are widely known, and the approach covered most emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. It covers all the important aspects of the question and provides additional details about the reporting requirements, including the identification of common ownership or control of multiple wells in a basin and the calculation methods and emission factors to be used for reporting. The answer also acknowledges the importance of the provided tables containing emission factors for different components and materials used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, which are essential for calculating and reporting emissions accurately.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. It also mentions the benefits of this requirement, such as proper monitoring and reporting of emissions, identification of common ownership or control of multiple wells, and consistency and accuracy in reported data. The answer also acknowledges the importance of the provided tables containing emission factors for accurate reporting of emissions.",4,0.3566433566,,,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of why EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. It also mentions the importance of reporting by basin in accurately tracking and regulating emissions from these facilities, identifying common ownership or control of multiple wells in a basin, and covering gathering and boosting equipment used to collect and transport petroleum and/or natural gas from onshore production gas or oil wells. The answer also highlights the EPA's role in specifying the calculation methods and emission factors to be used for reporting, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the reported data. The provided tables contain emission factors for different components and materials used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering, which are essential for calculating and reporting emissions accurately.",1231,,
63,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","Facilities have several options to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring if GOR value for a well is not available. They can use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category, delay reporting the GOR data element for wildcat and/or delineation wells, or use one of the specified procedures to determine GOR as outlined in the regulations. Additionally, the document provides default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and other relevant data that can be used to calculate GOR for associated gas venting and flaring. The emission factors and component counts can be used in conjunction with the specified procedures to determine GOR in the absence of GOR value for a well.","Facilities have several options to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring if GOR value for a well is not available.

It mentions the average gas to oil ratio in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil, the GOR for well testing, and the GOR threshold for reporting emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing. It also discusses the use of default oil and gas compositions in software programs if well production oil and gas compositions are not available. The text emphasizes the importance of determining GOR from available data and provides alternative procedures for GOR determination. Additionally, the document includes various equations and explanations related to fuel combustion, high heat value, CO2 emission factors, conversion factors, and annual emissions for different fuel types. Furthermore, it presents tables containing default emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. Overall, the document outlines the key considerations and methods for determining GOR in the context of environmental regulations.","The text provides detailed information about determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, including the calculation methodology and reporting requirements.

66,How should a gathering and boosting facility that previously reporting under Subpart C report in RY2016?,"In RY2016, the gathering and boosting facility that previously reported under Subpart C should report the quantity of gas received in thousand standard cubic feet and report GHG emissions from fuel combusted in stationary or portable equipment. The facility should use the methods specified in § 98.233(z) to report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. The provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services, which can be used to calculate the GHG emissions from the fuel combustion. The emission factors can be used in conjunction with the quantity of gas received to calculate the GHG emissions. Additionally, the tables provide information on population emission factors for different components and services, which can also be used in the emission calculation process.","The gathering and boosting facility that previously reported under Subpart C should report in RY2016 by providing the quantity of gas received in thousand standard cubic feet, reporting GHG emissions from fuel combusted in stationary or portable equipment, and using the methods in § 98.233(z) to report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment.{

}","Combustion emissions for the Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting segment are calculated using methods outlined in 40 CFR 98.233(z). Those methods provide flexibility to use Subpart C emission factors if the fuel combusted is natural gas, is pipeline quality, and has a minimum high heat value of 950 Btu per standard cubic foot. If the fuel meets those criteria, then you may use the emission factor for natural gas as listed in 40 CFR Part 98, Subpart C, Table C-1.  See 40 CFR 98.233(z)(1).",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that facilities covered by the Subpart W Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting industry segment cannot use Subpart C emission factors for calculating combustion emissions. The answer addresses all important aspects of the question and is perfectly relevant.,5,"The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context. The document specifies that emissions from fuel combusted in stationary or portable equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering and boosting facilities will be reported according to specific requirements specified in § 98.236(z) and not according to the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part. Therefore, facilities covered by the Subpart W Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting industry segment cannot use Subpart C emission factors for calculating combustion emissions.",2,0.3076923077,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear and direct response to the question.

71,"What is the definition of  ""fractionate"" and ""fractionation"" in 98.230(a)(3)?","The terms 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in 98.230(a)(3) refer to the process of separating natural gas liquids (NGLs) into their individual component products such as ethane, propane, butanes, and pentane-plus. NGL fractionators are installations that perform this process. The regulations outline procedures for NGL fractionators to follow, including reporting quantities of constituents of mixtures or blends separately, using measurement for NGLs at custody transfer meters, and determining quantity based on meter records or estimates. Additionally, the document specifies calculation methods and reporting requirements for NGL fractionators, such as using specific equations and default values for CO2 emission factors. It also mentions the need to demonstrate repeatable calculations for certain factors and provides alternative methods for sampling and analysis in specific situations.","Fractionate and fractionation are terms used in the context of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and refer to the process of separating NGLs into their individual component products such as ethane, propane, butanes, and pentane-plus.

75,"If fuel gas lines are not owned or operated by a gas processing facility, but are on the gas processing facility property, do the fuel gas lines need to be monitored for equipment leaks?","The text mentions that the annual average flow rate of fuel gas should not exceed 345 standard cubic feet per minute at 60 °F and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute. It also provides a method for calculating the annual average flow rate using company records, assuming total flow is evenly distributed over 525,600 minutes per year. This indicates that there are regulations and guidelines for monitoring the flow rate of fuel gas. However, the text does not explicitly state whether the fuel gas lines need to be monitored for equipment leaks if they are not owned or operated by a gas processing facility but are on the gas processing facility property. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is inconclusive whether the fuel gas lines need to be monitored for equipment leaks in this specific scenario.","The text mentions the annual average flow rate of fuel gas, which should not exceed 345 standard cubic feet per minute at 60 °F and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute. It also provides a method for calculating the annual average flow rate using company records, assuming total flow is evenly distributed over 525,600 minutes per year. Additionally, it discusses the use of common pipe configurations for reporting combined emissions from multiple combustion units. The text also refers to the use of stripping gas and the need for flow meters in certain scenarios.{

The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",3,"The answer partially addresses the main aspect of the question by correctly stating the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities.

It also mentions that for the first 6 months of required data collection, facilities that become newly subject to subpart W may use best engineering estimates for any data that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart.

However, there is no direct mention of the specific thresholds (25,000 MT CO2e and 25 MMscf per day throughput) or their precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility.","The document specifies that if a conflict exists between a provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence. It also mentions that for the first 6 months of required data collection, facilities that become newly subject to subpart W may use best engineering estimates for any data that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart. Additionally, it outlines the conditions under which a facility or supplier may discontinue complying with a subpart, and the requirements for reporting under different subparts. However, it does not explicitly state which specific threshold takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility.{

While the answer does not explicitly state which specific threshold takes precedence for determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility, it provides relevant information on the conflict resolution between subparts, data collection requirements, and reporting requirements. Additionally, it includes tables with data on default emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, which may be useful for further research on the topic.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on the precedence of subparts and the use of best engineering estimates for data collection.

81,May engineering calculations be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product?,"The document provides guidance on calculating emissions from flare gas composition, including the use of continuous gas composition analyzers, engineering calculations, and methods for determining gas-specific heel factors and flare gas higher heating value. It also outlines the calculation methodology for estimating CO2 emissions resulting from the combustion of natural gas and NGL products. The use of engineering calculations and process knowledge is permitted for estimating the carbon content of flared gas during start-up, shutdown, or malfunction events. Additionally, the document includes default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and leaker emission factors for various components and services. The tables provide detailed information on emission factors for different equipment and services, which can be used in engineering calculations to estimate flare gas composition and emissions.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The document specifies two paragraphs, 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1), which outline different methods for monitoring tank emissions. Paragraph 98.233(k) requires annual monitoring of the tank vapor vent stack using specified methods, while paragraph 98.234(a)(1) allows for the use of continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) to quantify CO2 mass emissions. Intermittent emissions from the storage tank can be addressed by monitoring the changes in container weights and inventories, or by monitoring the mass flow of the pure cover gas or carrier gas into the gas distribution system. Additionally, an alternative method to quantify the emissions may be used if it meets the applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements. The document also mentions the calculation method for CO2 emissions under Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, as well as the monitoring of CH4 liberated from degasification systems and ventilation systems. The methodology for calculating total emissions from multiple sources is also documented. Furthermore, the document provides tables with population emission factors, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default whole gas leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage. These tables contain valuable information for quantifying emissions and selecting appropriate monitoring methods.","The methods for monitoring tank emissions are specified in paragraphs 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1).

","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",5,"The answer accurately describes the difference between the methods in paragraphs 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, as well as how to treat intermittent emissions from the storage tank and the possibility of using alternative methods. The answer also mentions additional information provided in the document, such as the calculation method for CO2 emissions, monitoring of CH4, and various tables with emission factors and component counts. Therefore, the answer has perfect relevance to the question and context.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, how intermittent emissions from the storage tank can be addressed, and whether an alternative method can be used to quantify the emissions. The answer also mentions additional information provided in the document, such as the calculation method for CO2 emissions, monitoring of CH4, and methodology for calculating total emissions from multiple sources.",1,0.2476635514,1,"The answer provides a clear and detailed explanation of the different methods for monitoring tank emissions, including how to address intermittent emissions and the possibility of using alternative methods.

86,"For transmission tank venting sent to the flare, the reporter is referred to the emissions source for flare stack emissions, but guidance is only provided for upstream production and gas processing in this section.","The document mentioned the requirement to report information if scrubber dump valve leakage occurred for a transmission storage tank vent stack and the vent stack vented to a flare during the calendar year. It also specifies the calculation method for determining storage tank emissions sent to a flare. However, the guidance provided in this section is mainly focused on upstream production and gas processing, and there is no specific guidance for transmission tank venting sent to the flare. The document also provides tables with default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services in the Eastern and Western U.S. These tables can be used to estimate emissions from various components. However, there is no specific guidance or formula provided for calculating emissions from transmission tank venting sent to a flare. Therefore, it seems that the document lacks specific guidance for this scenario.","The text mentions the requirement to report information if scrubber dump valve leakage occurred for a transmission storage tank vent stack and the vent stack vented to a flare during the calendar year.

The answer also correctly identifies the equipment included in this process, such as compressors, equipment for liquids separation, and tanks for the storage of water and hydrocarbon liquids.",2,0.0941176471,1,The answer provides a clear and complete definition of onshore natural gas transmission compression without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally, providing a clear and concise definition of the onshore natural gas transmission compression. The answer also includes relevant information on emission factors, default component counts, and total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, which are important for the calculation and reporting of emissions from the onshore natural gas transmission compression. Overall, the answer is perfectly coherent and provides a comprehensive explanation of the topic.",1669,,
89,How does a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability?,"The natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determines subpart applicability based on the equipment components at the facility and the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. The facility must report the indication per facility, not per component type, and may elect to comply with specific regulations for equipment components at the facility. Additionally, the facility must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service to calculate component emissions. The facility may also choose to conduct equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period. The document also provides various default emission factors and population emission factors for different components and services, which can be used to calculate emissions from the equipment components at the facility.","A natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability based on the equipment components at the facility and the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment.

It specifies reporting thresholds for certain emission sources and discusses blowdown vent stack emissions. Additionally, it includes tables with default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, and onshore natural gas processing plants. The tables also provide information on leaker emission factors for different survey methods and population emission factors for various components. Overall, the document outlines the reporting requirements and calculation methods for both intentional and unintentional natural gas releases.","The document mentions that vented emissions include intentional or designed releases of natural gas, and it specifies reporting requirements for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. It also provides calculation methods for annual natural gas emissions and specifies reporting thresholds for certain emission sources. The document also discusses blowdown vent stack emissions and provides definitions for terms such as LNG boil-off gas and centrifugal compressor dry seal emissions.

It also provides tables with emission factors for different equipment and components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting, as well as for underground natural gas storage. However, it does not specifically address the reporting of emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir.","The document provides information on annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in metric tons resulting from venting gas directly to the atmosphere. It also mentions the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) for quantifying CO2 mass emissions and the calculation method for annual emissions from each applicable source category. Additionally, it discusses excess emissions of fluorinated GHGs resulting from destruction device malfunctions and the calculation of annual emissions from production and transformation processes. However, it does not specifically address the reporting of emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir.{

This follows logically from the information contained in the context.,2,0.2598870056,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the answer does not specifically address the reporting of emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir, it provides information on various methods and equations for quantifying and calculating emissions from different sources, including underground natural gas storage.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on various methods and equations for quantifying and calculating emissions from different sources, as well as tables with emission factors for different equipment and components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting, as well as for underground natural gas storage. However, it does not specifically address the reporting of emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir. The sentences do not fit together perfectly and sound a bit disjointed, but the overall quality of the answer is acceptable.",623,,
93,Could EPA clarify that the natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W?,"The text provides a clear explanation that the natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W. This is because it does not meet the criteria of subsurface storage, including depleted gas or oil reservoirs and salt dome caverns, for the primary purpose of load balancing. The text also mentions the definition of LNG storage and various equipment and processes related to natural gas storage and processing. Additionally, the text includes several tables providing emission factors for different components and equipment related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These tables can be used to calculate emissions based on the component counts and emission factors. However, there are no specific numerical values mentioned in the question, so no further calculations or comparisons are necessary.","The natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W, as it does not meet the criteria of subsurface storage, including depleted gas or oil reservoirs and salt dome caverns, for the primary purpose of load balancing.

It can be inferred that separate emission reports may be required for the respective operators of the storage wellheads, as each operator is responsible for the emissions associated with their operations.",2,0.301369863,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear inference based on the information provided in the document. It also mentions the availability of default emission factors for different components and equipment, which can be used by the respective operators to calculate and report their emissions.

96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"The text mentions that underground natural gas storage facilities must use appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service. However, it does not provide different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment. The provided tables include default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, which specify different emission factors for different components such as valve, connector, open-ended line, pressure relief valve, meter, and other components. These emission factors vary based on the survey method used. It is possible that the absence of different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components in natural gas storage facilities is due to the specific nature of the storage facilities and the survey methods used, which may not require separate emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components.","The text mentions that underground natural gas storage facilities must use appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service, and also specifies the annual volume of natural gas placed into storage and withdrawn from storage. However, it does not provide different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.{

These tables provide emission factors for different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps. The emission factors vary based on the survey methods used, such as survey methods in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) or Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7). Additionally, there are tables for total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage. These tables provide emission factors for different components and survey methods. The information in the text can be used to understand the emission reporting requirements and calculate emissions based on the provided factors and survey methods.","The facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for enhanced oil recovery and storage should report under subpart A requirements. The facility includes all equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, including CO2 EOR operations, under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin. The facility also encompasses onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment. It should report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific source types, and must indicate whether a CO2 stream was injected into subsurface geologic formations for enhanced natural gas recovery.{

It mentions the need to report under subpart A requirements and to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific source types. The answer also highlights the availability of tables with emission factors for different components and survey methods, which can be used to calculate emissions. However, the answer does not explicitly mention the relevance of the answer to the question, which is why it is not a perfect score of 5.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate summary of the reporting requirements for a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas storage, and enhanced oil recovery.

It also outlines calculation methods for annual mass and volumetric emissions from glycol dehydrators, as well as the definition of underground natural gas storage. However, it does not explicitly state whether dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility.

It mentions the use of EPA Method 21 for detecting leaks and provides options for conducting equipment leak surveys across multiple years. Additionally, it discusses the methodology for establishing expected baselines for monitoring CO2 surface leakage and the use of alternative approaches in EPA Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates. The document also includes several tables providing default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and population emission factors for various gas services. These tables can be used to calculate emissions from leaking sources as per the given regulations.","The document provides detailed requirements for conducting leak detection surveys for different components, including the use of specific leak detection methods and the calculation of equipment leak emissions.

However, it does not explicitly address whether a facility must indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys, including the fact that at least one survey must be conducted in a calendar year and that multiple surveys must be used when calculating emissions. It also mentions the reporting requirements for facilities conducting surveys across a multiple year cycle and the specific methods for leak detection. The answer acknowledges that the document does not explicitly state whether a facility must indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year, which is a valid point and does not detract from the overall accuracy of the response.",2,0.3194103194,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys, including the minimum number of surveys required in a calendar year, the use of results from multiple surveys, reporting requirements for facilities performing surveys across multiple years, and the specific methods for leak detection. The answer also mentions the guidance provided in the document for developing a site-specific leak monitoring approach and accounting for possible sources of error. However, the answer does not explicitly address whether a facility must indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year.",1185,,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"The document provides detailed information about equipment leaks from various components in different services, along with the requirement for conducting equipment leak surveys using specific leak detection methods. It also specifies the conditions under which certain components are exempt from the survey requirements. However, it does not mention any specific numbers related to the frequency of leak surveys or the potential for a sunset provision by the EPA. The document also includes tables with default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing plants, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for underground natural gas storage, default methane population emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage, and default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for underground natural gas storage. These tables provide emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services, which can be used to calculate emissions and assess the need for annual leak surveys.","The document provides detailed information about equipment leaks from various components in different services, along with the requirement for conducting equipment leak surveys using specific leak detection methods.

}","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",2,"The answer mostly lacks relevance as it does not directly address the specific monitoring percentages mentioned in the question. Instead, it provides information about the requirements for GHG Monitoring Plans, annual monitoring reports, and the components they should contain, as well as tables with population emission factors and default average component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment. While this information may be useful for developing a monitoring plan, it does not answer the question about whether a monitoring plan with specific percentages would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'",1,"It is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information. The provided answer provides information about GHG Monitoring Plans, but it does not directly address the specific monitoring percentages mentioned in the question.",1,0.1678321678,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,2,"The answer mostly lacks coherence. While it provides some information about GHG Monitoring Plans and the tables provided in the document, it does not directly address the specific monitoring percentages mentioned in the question. The answer seems to be a general overview of the document rather than a specific response to the question asked.",1244,,
113,What types of instruments are permissible for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W?,"The document specifies that the permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include acoustic leak detection devices and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments. The acoustic leak detection device must be used to quantify through-valve leakage using the instrument manufacturer's calculation methods, and a leak is detected if a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated. Additionally, acoustic stethoscope type devices can be used to identify non-leakers, with subsequent measurement required to calculate the rate if through-valve leakage is identified. Method 21 is also mentioned as a permissible instrument for equipment leak detection, with a leak being detected if an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured. The document also provides emission factors for different components and source types required for monitoring using these instruments, which can be used to calculate the emission rate based on the detected leaks.","The permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include acoustic leak detection devices and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments.

This is because the text specifies that acid gas refers to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) contaminants separated from sour natural gas by an AGR unit. Therefore, any unit designed to separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from a stream, whether it is a liquid or gas stream, would be considered an acid gas removal unit.","The text provides a detailed definition of acid gas removal units (AGR) and outlines the calculation methods for CO2 emissions from AGR units. It also specifies the components and parameters to be reported for each AGR unit, such as annual CO2 emissions, annual volume of gas vented, and the calculation method used. The text also clarifies that acid gas refers to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) contaminants separated from sour natural gas by an AGR unit. Based on this information, AGR units used only to sweeten a liquid stream, such as amine, membrane, molecular sieve, or other absorbents and adsorbents, would meet the definition of acid gas removal units as they are designed to separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from the stream.{

The text specifies that acid gas refers to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) contaminants separated from sour natural gas by an AGR unit. Therefore, any unit designed to separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from a stream, whether it is a liquid or gas stream, would be considered an acid gas removal unit. The answer correctly identifies that AGR units used only to sweeten a liquid stream would meet the definition of acid gas removal units.",2,0.496350365,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any indication of uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of how AGR units used only to sweeten a liquid stream meet the definition of acid gas removal units.

It specifies that if CO2 emissions from the AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, they should be adjusted downward by the magnitude of the recovered emissions. It also outlines various calculation methods for determining CO2 emissions from the AGR unit. Therefore, if all emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and adjust the emissions downward to account for the recovered emissions. The provided tables contain default emission factors and average component counts for different equipment and services, which can be used in the calculation of emissions. The document also mentions different survey methods and their associated leaker emission factors, which can be utilized in the emission calculation process. Overall, the document provides a comprehensive framework for calculating and reporting CO2 emissions from the AGR unit, including the necessary adjustments for recovered emissions.","The document provides information on the calculation and reporting of CO2 emissions from an Acid Gas Removal (AGR) unit.

This follows logically from the information contained in the context, which specifies that if CO2 emissions from the AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, they should be adjusted downward by the magnitude of the recovered emissions. Therefore, the answer is entailed by the context.",3,0.3967611336,1,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the calculation and reporting of CO2 emissions from an AGR unit, including the necessary adjustments for recovered emissions. It also outlines various calculation methods and provides default emission factors and average component counts for different equipment and services. Therefore, the answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.",5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the calculation and reporting of CO2 emissions from an Acid Gas Removal (AGR) unit, including the necessary adjustments for recovered emissions. The answer also mentions the default emission factors and average component counts for different equipment and services, as well as the different survey methods and their associated leaker emission factors, which can be utilized in the emission calculation process. Overall, the answer is comprehensive and provides a thorough understanding of the topic.",1159,,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"The document provides information on various emission factors and population emission factors for different components and equipment used in natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. It also includes default average component counts for major equipment and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. Additionally, it presents default leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, as well as total hydrocarbon emission factors for natural gas processing and transmission compression. However, it does not specifically address the estimation of emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.","The document mentions provisions for calculating emissions for CO2 vented directly to the atmosphere or emitted through a flare, engine, or sulfur recovery plant from acid gas removal vents. It also discusses the injection of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery, and the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide. However, it does not specifically address the estimation of emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.{

However, there are no specific equations or calculation methods provided in the text for deriving the emission from AGR vents. The text does provide tables with default emission factors and average component counts for different equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting. These tables can be used to calculate emissions based on the specific components and equipment used in AGR venting processes. For example, the 'Default Whole Gas Emission Factors' table provides emission factors for different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic devices, which can be used in emission calculations. Similarly, the 'Default Average Component Counts' table provides the average counts of valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves for different equipment, which can be used in conjunction with emission factors to estimate emissions. However, the text does not explicitly state whether the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required for AGR vents. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine whether the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required for AGR vents.","The text mentions the calculation methods for emissions from Acid Gas Removal (AGR) vents, which includes processes such as amine, membrane, molecular sieve, or other absorbents and adsorbents.

","The units of measure for emissions calculated in Equation W-3 are in cubic feet per year. However, §98.233(d)(10) requires that the volumetric emissions of equation W-3 be converted into mass emissions using §98.233(v)’s methods.  You must report emissions in metric tons of CO2e to meet the reporting requirements in §98.236(c)(3)(v).  If reporters use the methodology set forth in §98.233(d)(2), then a vent flow meter must be used to determine the total annual volume of vent gas flowing out of the AGR unit.",,,1,"The answer does not provide a clear and direct response to the question. It mentions several calculation methodologies, equations, and emission factors for different components and services related to natural gas and petroleum production, gathering, and processing, but it does not explicitly mention Equation W-3. Additionally, the document does not provide specific information about using a flow meter to calculate annual CO2 emissions.",1,0.193236715,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the document does not explicitly mention Equation W-3, it provides guidance on using flow or volume measurement systems to calculate emissions and specifies the use of quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) for certain calculations. The answer also mentions the calculation methodologies, equations, and emission factors for different components and services related to natural gas and petroleum production, gathering, and processing.",2,"The answer mostly lacks coherence. While it provides information about calculation methodologies, equations, and emission factors, it does not directly answer the question about Equation W-3 and the use of flow meters for calculating CO2 emissions. The answer lacks a clear and concise explanation of the required units of measure and the use of flow meters, making it difficult to follow and understand.",895,,
123,For blowdown vent stacks does the 98.233.i reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume refer to a gas volume or a physical container volume?,"The document mentions that equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section. This indicates that the reference to containers less than 50 cubic feet total physical volume refers to the physical container volume, not the gas volume. The text does not provide any specific calculation or formula related to this, but it clearly states that the regulation is based on the physical volume of the container, not the gas volume.","The text mentions that equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section.

The context clearly states that equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section.

124,"May average blowdown volumes be used for industry segments (processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports) where reporting of this emission source is required?","The document provides a method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks using a flow meter. It specifies that emissions may be measured using a flow meter for unique physical volumes greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. The document also outlines the calculation of annual CH4 and CO2 volumetric and mass emissions measured by the meters. It further details the methods for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks according to equipment or event type for different industry segments. Additionally, it mentions the measurement of volumetric emissions from blowdown valves and isolation valves on compressors, and the inclusion of compressor blowdown emissions in the metered emissions for the manifolded group of compressor sources. The document does not provide specific equations or calculations for deriving average blowdown volumes for industry segments. However, it does contain tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, which could be used in conjunction with the mentioned flow meter method to calculate average blowdown volumes for industry segments where reporting of this emission source is required.","The document provides a method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks using a flow meter.

133,"For Equation W-21, Flare Emissions, Do you use ""5"" for Rj (number of carbon atoms) for hydrocarbons with more than 5 carbons?","Equation W-21 is used to calculate emissions from the consumption of each fluorinated GHG, including intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG. For hydrocarbons with more than 5 carbon atoms, the utilization and by-product formation rates of zero are assumed, and Equation I–8 and I–9 of this subpart are used for calculation. The given text does not directly mention the specific use of '5' for Rj (number of carbon atoms) for hydrocarbons with more than 5 carbon atoms. However, it provides tables with emission factors and component counts for different equipment and materials, which could be used in the calculation process as per the mentioned equations.","Equation W-21 is used to calculate emissions from the consumption of each fluorinated GHG, including intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG.

}","However, for the 2011 reporting year onwards, you must include flare stack emissions in the applicability determination, as flares are included under subpart W.Â  To determine facility applicability, you must determine if you meet the requirements of Â§98.2(a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3).Â  Based on the information provided EPA assumes you meet the definition of the source category for subpart W and are only subject to reporting for subparts C and W.",2,The answer mostly lacks relevance as it does not provide a clear answer to the question and does not address the specific mention of flare emissions in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a).,1,The answer does not provide a clear indication of whether flare emissions are included in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a). It only states that the specific mention of this is not explicitly addressed in the provided text.,1,0.2919708029,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty by stating that the specific mention of whether flare emissions are included in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a) is not explicitly addressed in the provided text. However, it still contains an attempt to answer the question by providing detailed information on the calculation methods for determining the annual emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O resulting from the combustion of hydrocarbon gas in flares and outlining procedures for adjusting emissions during well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on the calculation methods for determining flare emissions, but it does not explicitly state whether flare emissions are included in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a).",571,,

136,Does a simple open pipe with no flare tip count as a flare under 98.233 (n ) in Subpart W?,"The document does not explicitly address whether a simple open pipe with no flare tip counts as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W. However, it provides various equations and tables related to emission factors, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for different components and equipment used in natural gas production and processing. These equations and tables can be used to calculate emissions and determine if a simple open pipe without a flare tip would be considered a flare under the specified regulation. Further analysis and specific information about the characteristics of the open pipe and its operation would be needed to make a conclusive determination.","The document mentions the definition of a flare as a combustion device that uses an open or closed flame to combust waste gases without energy recovery. It also discusses the use of flow meters for measuring fuel gas and the reporting requirements for different types of facilities.

}","Yes, emergency flares are covered under the general category of flares.  For reporting purposes, in the final rule, EPA reduced the burden associated with the flare monitoring and reporting requirements by allowing the use of engineering calculations based on process knowledge, company records, and best available data for estimating flow volumes and gas compositions.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question. It does not address whether emissions from all flares at the gas processing facility or on or associated with a well pad are required to be reported under Subpart W, which was the main focus of the question.",1,"The answer does not provide a clear and direct response to the question. It provides information on reporting requirements and methods for calculating emissions under Subpart W, but does not specifically address whether emissions from all flares at the gas processing facility or on or associated with a well pad, including emergency flares, are required to be reported. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.1791044776,1,"The answer provides clear guidance on reporting requirements and methods for calculating emissions under Subpart W of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems.

It mentions that facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources using the methods in § 98.233(z). It also defines 'flare' as a combustion device that uses an open or closed flame to combust waste gases without energy recovery. However, the answer does not directly address the question of whether emissions from all flares at the gas processing facility or on or associated with a well pad, including emergency flares, are required to be reported under Subpart W. Hence, the coherence of the answer is mostly coherent, but not perfect.",1108,,
