16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting differ between transmission compression and underground storage due to specific characteristics and operational differences between the two types of equipment.

The differences in units are influenced by factors such as pressure, temperature, gas composition, and the specific calculation methodologies and considerations for the emission factors as specified in Subpart W of Part 98. Additionally, the population emission factors for natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, the concentration of GHG (CH4 or CO2) in produced natural gas, and the average estimated number of hours in the operating year the pumps were operational contribute to the variations in the units used for vented emissions.","ural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment as specified in § 98.232(d)(2), (e)(2), (f)(2), (g) sion pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage.

28,"How does EPA define a ""facility"" for petroleum and natural gas systems?","The EPA defines a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems as any equipment, structure, or activity that is located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties and is under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) and from which an annual average of daily natural gas throughput is greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day. This includes equipment used for onshore natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export, as specified in § 98.232(d)(1), (e)(1), (f)(1), (g), and other related activities such as gathering and boosting equipment, natural gas distribution, and onshore petroleum and natural gas production. Therefore, a 'facility' encompasses a wide range of equipment and activities involved in the production, processing, and distribution of natural gas and petroleum. Additionally, the definition is based on the equipment and components involved in the production, gathering, boosting, transmission, storage, and distribution of petroleum and natural gas, including valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic devices, pumps, flanges, separators, meters, compressors, in-line heaters, dehydrators, wellheads, and more.

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) has a significant impact on estimating emissions. Owners or operators are allowed to use best available monitoring methods for scoping speciations, emission factors, or emission characterizations to estimate emissions occurring from January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2011. The proposed best available monitoring method may involve the use of current monitoring data in the mass-balance approach, and it is required to include estimated relative and absolute errors. Additionally, facilities may estimate emissions (consumption) of cover gases and carrier gases by monitoring changes in container weights and inventories using specific equations. Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring methods to estimate 2011 emissions can be made, and the determination of emissions may involve the carbon mass balance method or the site-specific emission factor method. The use of best available monitoring methods is subject to compliance with monitoring and QA/QC procedures specified in the regulations. The use of BAMM can affect emissions by providing more accurate and reliable data on the emission factors for various components in different services such as gas, light crude, and heavy crude. By using the emission factors provided in the tables, operators can estimate the emissions from their onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. Additionally, the population emission factors in the tables can help in understanding the average emissions from the entire population of components, both leaking and non-leaking, which can further aid in emission estimation and monitoring. Furthermore, the use of BAMM affected emissions by providing a comprehensive approach to monitoring and quantifying GHG emissions from various sources such as natural gas pneumatic devices, nitric acid production, fuel and feedstock consumption, and more. The methods involve factors such as emission factors, inventory of gases, abatement utilization factors, and stoichiometric ratios to accurately calculate the annual total volumetric GHG emissions at standard conditions. These methods also consider the population emission factors, concentration of GHGs, and the average estimated number of hours in the operating year the devices were operational. By utilizing these methods, industries can accurately assess and manage their emissions to reduce environmental impact.","ent year emissions., (1) Best available monitoring methods.

34,"How do I determine ""actual"" temperature and pressure in emission calculations?","To determine the 'actual' temperature and pressure in emission calculations, you can refer to the default whole gas emission factors provided in Table W-1A to Subpart W of Part 98.

35,What are the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available?,"To determine the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available, there are several approaches that can be taken. One option is to use the annual average gas composition based on the most recent analysis of the sub-basin, which can include a default 95 percent methane and 1 percent carbon dioxide fraction for GHG mole fraction in natural gas, or site-specific engineering estimates based on best available data. If annual samples are taken, a specific equation should be applied. Additionally, for onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, the GHG mole percent in feed natural gas liquid for all streams can be used. It's important to ensure that the sensitivity of the analysis is sufficient when sampling and analyzing streams where fluorinated GHG by-products occur at less than their maximum concentrations. Emissions must be estimated at least annually if a continuous gas analyzer is not available or installed. Another approach is to refer to the default whole gas emission factors provided in the tables for various equipment components and services. These emission factors are specified in standard cubic feet per hour per component and can be used as a proxy for estimating GHG emissions in the absence of continuous gas composition analyzer data. Finally, the calculation of the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations may also involve considering the annual total volumetric GHG emissions at standard conditions in standard cubic feet per year from natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting, population emissions factors for natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, the concentration of GHG in produced natural gas, the average estimated number of hours the pumps were operational in the operating year, and the usage rate for a particular cover or carrier gas over the period of comparable operation, as well as the inventory of each cover gas or carrier gas stored in cylinders or other containers at the beginning and end of the year.

36,What are the requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare?,"The requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare involve multiple factors. Firstly, the continuous gas composition analyzer on the feed gas to the flare is used to analyze the composition of the gas, including the percentage of different components such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This composition analysis is crucial for calculating the volume of gas sent to the flare, in standard cubic feet, using the molar volume conversion factor (scf per kg-mole). Additionally, the volume of flare gas combusted (in scf/year) and the annual average molecular weight (in kg/kg-mole) or the annual mass of flare gas combusted (in kg/yr) are important factors in determining the volume of gas sent to a flare. Furthermore, the flow rate of the gas in standard cubic feet per hour (scf/h) and the duration of time the gas is being flared, typically measured in hours, are essential requirements. Once these requirements are known, the volume of gas sent to a flare can be calculated using the formula: Volume = Flow rate (scf/h) * Time (hours).

54,How should the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks be determined to compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1)?,"The daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks should be determined by calculating the total annual oil/condensate throughput that is sent to all atmospheric tanks in the basin, in barrels. This data element may be delayed for reporting if the average daily natural gas throughput is greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, or if there are glycol dehydrators with an annual average daily natural gas throughput less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day. Additionally, for plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater, the calculation should consider the total oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to applicable onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting sites. To compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1), you would need to calculate the total oil throughput for the day from the onshore production storage tanks by summing up the daily oil production from each storage tank. If the total oil throughput from all the storage tanks exceeds 10 barrels a day, then it would be considered to exceed the threshold as per 98.233.j(1).

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin for several reasons. Firstly, it allows for comprehensive reporting of emissions and activities associated with each geologic province, enabling targeted mitigation strategies and effective monitoring of the industry's activities. Secondly, reporting by basin captures the variability in emission factors across different geographical areas, leading to more accurate estimation of emissions by taking into account specific basin characteristics. Additionally, reporting by basin helps in accurately tracking and monitoring CO2e emissions, calibration errors, reference values, and destruction efficiency associated with the annual CO2 mass emissions for specific fuel types in metric tons. This approach enables a more detailed understanding of the environmental impact, regulatory compliance, and greenhouse gas emissions, ultimately leading to more informed decision-making and improved environmental stewardship.","ural gas gathering and boosting facilities do not report the information specified in paragraphs (j)(1)(ix) and (xi) of this section., (i) Sub-basin ID (for onshore production) or county name e sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or from the county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting., (C) Analyze a representative sample of s 60.5397a of this chapter.

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, you have several options. Firstly, you can calculate the GOR for each well whose associated natural gas is vented or flared. If individual well GOR data is not available, you can use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the production gas/oil ratio and API gravity. Then, assume all of the CH4 and CO2 in both oil and gas are emitted from the tank. Alternatively, you can use the default whole gas emission factors provided in Table W-1A to Subpart W of Part 98 to calculate the GOR for your gathering pipelines by comparing the emission factors for gas service components with the emission factors for oil service components. Additionally, you can determine the GOR by measuring the volume of gas and oil being produced using flow meters and other measurement devices at the gathering point, and then calculating the ratio by dividing the volume of gas by the volume of oil. Gathering pipelines with a GOR less than 300 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel (scf/STB) are not included in this industry segment. Therefore, you can calculate the GOR based on the specific requirements mentioned for the wells and clusters of wells.","ies in the effluent of a stationary source., Gas to oil ratio (GOR) means the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when 8.236(cc) the gas to oil ratio for the well and the well ID number for the well., (B) Volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production after completions of each newly drilled well le fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing 98.233 to calculate the average gas production rate for an oil well, then you must report the information specified in paragraphs (g)(5)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section., (A) Gas to oil ratio 1) Determine the GOR of the hydrocarbon production from each well whose associated natural gas is vented or flared.

71,"What is the definition of  ""fractionate"" and ""fractionation"" in 98.230(a)(3)?","In 98.230(a)(3), the term 'fractionate' refers to the process of separating a mixture into its individual components or fractions, typically based on their boiling points. This process is commonly used in natural gas liquids fractionators to separate mixed NGLs into their constituent parts, such as ethane, propane, and butane. 'Fractionation' involves the actual act of separating the mixture, and it is a key process in the natural gas liquids industry for producing valuable products from the mixed NGLs received from other fractionators or natural gas processors. While the provided tables to Subpart W of Part 98 do not explicitly define 'fractionate' or 'fractionation', they mainly consist of default emission factors for various components and equipment in different natural gas and petroleum facilities. It's recommended to review the source document or content to locate the specific definitions of 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in 98.230(a)(3).","fractionator shall follow the following procedures., (1)(i) For fractionated NGLs received by the reporter from other NGL fractionators, you shall use Equation NN–7 of this section and the def I>Fossil fuel means natural gas, petroleum, coal, or any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material, for purpose of creating useful heat., Fractionators means ied less the quantity received from other fractionators using Equation NN–8 of this section. onate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors.

78,How should I calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids?,"To calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, you can use the default emission factors provided in Table W-2 to Subpart W of Part 98. The emission factors listed in this table can be used to estimate the emissions from various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and meters. By multiplying these emission factors with the average component counts for the major equipment in the specific region of interest (Eastern U.S. or Western U.S.), you can estimate the total emissions from the natural gas processing plants. It's important to ensure that the units of the emission factors and the component counts are consistent to obtain accurate results. Additionally, based on the provided information, onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. This reporting should be done for natural gas processing facilities as specified in § 98.233(j). Furthermore, the emissions from the natural gas transmission pipeline industry segment should be reported if the specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, as per § 98.232(m). Finally, the reporting threshold for such a facility would be 25,000 metric tons CO2e / year, calculated using the formula: Reporting Threshold = 25,000 metric tons CO2e / year * (1 - F) * (1 - D), where F is the fraction of gas liquids removed from the natural gas stream at the facility, and D is the fraction of CO2 captured and sequestered. If the facility does not fractionate gas liquids, then F would be 0.

The text analysis indicates that under subpart W, you are required to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane.
