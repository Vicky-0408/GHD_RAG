The applicability tool only serves as a guide to determine those facilities that are clearly well below the reporting threshold, those clearly above, and those close to the threshold who will need to collect further data to make a proper determination.",5,"The answer provides a clear and complete response to the question, accurately summarizing the information provided in the context. It also goes beyond the initial question by mentioning additional information about the provided equations, tables, and specific emission factors related to natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground gas storage. Overall, the answer is highly relevant and comprehensive.",5,The answer directly states that the EPA will provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule. The context also supports this statement by providing additional details about the tool and its purpose.,1,0.3025210084,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally. It provides a clear and concise response to the question, and also includes additional information about the tools and resources provided by the EPA to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule. The answer also mentions the specific equations, tables, and emission factors provided by the EPA for different components and survey methods, which shows a good understanding of the topic.",968,
4,Do the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements?,"Yes, the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements. The text analysis indicates that the facility definitions require notification to the EPA of the use of previously approved alternative methods in the annual report, retention of copies of all reports submitted to the EPA, and maintenance of sufficient records to support the information contained in those reports. Additionally, it outlines the timing of requests for extensions, the reporting of emissions from different industry segments, and the procedures for alternative methods of determining emissions. This demonstrates a clear impact on other EPA reporting requirements. The table analysis provides specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment and regions, which further emphasizes the impact of the facility definitions on reporting requirements related to emissions and equipment specifications.","Yes, the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements. The text mentions the need to notify the EPA of the use of previously approved alternative methods in the annual report, retention of copies of all reports submitted to EPA, maintenance of sufficient records to support information contained in those reports, and the requirement to report under specific subparts for different types of electricity generating units. Additionally, it outlines the timing of requests for extensions, the reporting of emissions from different industry segments, and the procedures for alternative methods of determining emissions. Therefore, the facility definitions in this rule do affect other EPA reporting requirements.{

The answer states that the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements, and provides specific examples of these requirements, such as notification to the EPA of the use of previously approved alternative methods in the annual report, retention of copies of all reports submitted to the EPA, and maintenance of sufficient records to support the information contained in those reports. The answer also mentions the timing of requests for extensions, the reporting of emissions from different industry segments, and the procedures for alternative methods of determining emissions. The table analysis further supports the impact of the facility definitions on reporting requirements related to emissions and equipment specifications. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",1,0.1395348837,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,The answer is well-structured and coherent.

6,How is the petroleum and natural gas systems source category defined?,"The petroleum and natural gas systems source category is defined by a wide range of facilities and emission sources related to petroleum and natural gas production, refining, and distribution. It includes petroleum refineries, importers, exporters of petroleum products, natural gas liquids fractionators, local natural gas distribution companies, natural gas processing facilities, offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, industrial waste landfills, and petrochemical production processes. The category also involves reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific source types based on the emission thresholds. Additionally, it encompasses various sources such as catalytic cracking units, fluid coking units, delayed coking units, catalytic reforming units, coke calcining units, asphalt blowing operations, blowdown systems, storage tanks, process equipment components in gas service, marine vessel loading operations, flares, sulfur recovery plants, and non-merchant hydrogen plants. The emission factors and component counts for different regions and equipment types are also specified to provide a comprehensive understanding of the emissions associated with onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. The default whole gas leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors for various components further contribute to the definition of this source category.","The petroleum and natural gas systems source category includes petroleum refineries, importers, exporters of petroleum products, natural gas liquids fractionators, and local natural gas distribution companies.

You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question asked. It states that facilities that must report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) include onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, onshore natural gas processing facilities, underground natural gas storage facilities, onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities, and LNG storage facilities.

8,What gases must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities?,"Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various equipment and activities including compressors, generators, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, flares, and other associated equipment. Therefore, CO2, CH4, and N2O are the gases that must be reported by oil and natural gas system facilities. Additionally, the provided tables contain detailed population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for different components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. The data includes emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components, as well as specific emission factors for methane and total hydrocarbons in various scenarios such as natural gas transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage. The tables also designate the Eastern and Western U.S. states and provide specific emission factors for different materials and equipment types. However, the provided LaTeX equations are incomplete and fragmented, making it difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis of the formulas. If there are specific equations or information that require further discussion, please provide them in a clear and complete format for additional analysis.","Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various equipment and activities including compressors, generators, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, flares, and other associated equipment.

See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how greenhouse gas emissions are calculated for subpart W facilities, including the use of specific emission factors and equipment types as outlined in the regulations.

For the first 6 months of required data collection, facilities that acquire new sources from another facility that were not previously subject to this subpart W may use best engineering estimates for any data related to those newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart. Additionally, the provided tables contain default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and other emission factors for various components and equipment in different locations across the Eastern and Western U.S. These factors and counts are essential for calculating and reporting emissions as per subpart W requirements.","The reporting for subpart W begins immediately for facilities that are currently subject to this subpart.

For 2012 only, the GHG report must be submitted to EPA by September 28, 2012. This reporting deadline applies to all subparts being reported by the facility. If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",,,5,The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by stating that reporting for subpart W begins immediately for facilities that are currently subject to this subpart.

13,The applicability tool for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas has an operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons. How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The operating factor for associated gas venting and flaring from produced hydrocarbons is directly related to the volume of oil produced in barrels during the time periods in which associated gas was vented or flared. The calculation of annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing is also a key factor in understanding the correlation between the operating factor and the barrels of crude oil produced. Additionally, the emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and gathering equipment, as well as the average component counts for major equipment, provide valuable data for understanding and managing the correlation between operating factor and crude oil production. The population emission factors and leaker emission factors for different equipment and services further contribute to assessing the impact of associated gas venting on crude oil production.","The operating factor for associated gas venting and flaring from produced hydrocarbons is directly related to the volume of oil produced in barrels during the time periods in which associated gas was vented or flared.

The answer accurately reflects this information and provides additional details about the content of the text and tables, which support the conclusion that no guidance on worst-case scenario estimation is provided.",3,0.225,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that EPA does not offer specific guidance on estimating a worst-case scenario for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks for the purpose of determining applicability. The answer also provides additional information related to the calculation of emissions, monitoring methods, and procedures for estimating GHG emissions, as well as data on emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and materials related to natural gas production and processing. However, the answer does not provide a clear and concise explanation of why EPA does not offer guidance on worst-case scenario estimation for GHG emissions from transmission storage tanks.",751,
16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The difference in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage in the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets is due to the use of different emission factors and calculation methods specified for each type of facility. For underground natural gas storage facilities, the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4A to this subpart are utilized. On the other hand, onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in Table W–3A to this subpart. This variance in emission factors and calculation methods leads to the difference in the units used for vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage.","In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting because different emission factors and calculation methods are specified for each type of facility. For example, underground natural gas storage facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4A to this subpart, while onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service listed in Table W–3A to this subpart.

20,"Do the emissions from external combustion sources with rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu per hour need to be included in the 25,000 metric ton threshold determination?","External fuel combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu/hr do not need to report combustion emissions or include these emissions for threshold determination in § 98.231(a). Therefore, emissions from external combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu per hour do not need to be included in the 25,000 metric ton threshold determination. Additionally, the equation W-2 is used to calculate the annual total volumetric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at standard conditions in standard cubic feet per year from all natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting for GHG concentration CH4 or CO2. The equation involves variables such as Es,i, Count, EF, GHGi, and T, with assumptions for T, the concentration of GHGi, and EF for High Continuous Bleed Pneumatic Device Vents. The calculation based on this equation yields CH4 emissions of 31,041,060 scf and CO2 emissions of 326,748 scf. Furthermore, various tables provide population emission factors, average component counts, and leaker emission factors for different equipment and components related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as natural gas transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage.","External fuel combustion sources with a rated heat capacity equal to or less than 5 mmBtu/hr do not need to report combustion emissions or include these emissions for threshold determination in § 98.231(a).

The text mentions that well workover equipment, including hydraulic fracturing equipment, is integral to the extraction, processing, or movement of oil or natural gas and should be reported. Additionally, the text specifies that emissions from well venting for liquids unloading and well workovers with hydraulic fracturing should be reported, which implies that truck loading and unloading associated with these activities should also be included for reporting GHG emissions under Subpart W.

Systems. Facilities subject to subpart W may use best engineering estimates for data related to newly acquired sources for the first 6 months of required data collection. Additionally, facilities that become newly subject to subpart W may also use best engineering estimates for the first 6 months of required data collection. Furthermore, facilities that report under subpart RR for a well or group of wells are not required to report under subpart W for that well or group of wells. Therefore, not all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report under subpart W.{
    ""result"": ""The provided input contains a mix of LaTeX equations and text. However, the equations are not complete or clear, making it difficult to provide a comprehensive explanation. It seems that the text includes various environmental and emissions-related parameters, such as annual emissions, conversion factors, and specific gas concentrations.

}","An onshore production facility is defined in 40 CFR 98.238 and will report only those emissions from the emissions sources listed in 40 CFR 98.232.  The onshore production facility has a single designated representative and does not include other industry segments or other source categories in its annual GHG report.  Similarly, if a facility meets the definition for natural gas distribution that facility reports only what’s listed in 98.232(i).  All other industry segments under subpart W use the definition of facility in subpart A and report emissions in a single annual GHG report.  Each facility must have one and only one designated representative.  But, the same DR could represent multiple facilities.  Other than onshore production and natural gas distribution, it is possible for a single facility to report under multiple industry segments.  Please see requirements in 98.231(a) and response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 in the EPA’s final Response to Public Comments Document for subpart W.",,,5,"The context clearly states that not all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report under subpart W.

The answer also includes relevant tables providing emission factors and average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities in the Eastern and Western U.S., as well as the designation of states in the Eastern and Western U.S. This information is all logically consistent with the context and provides a comprehensive answer to the question.",1,0.1062441752,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,The answer provides a clear definition of subpart W regulations and mentions that not all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report under subpart W.

24,What emissions are reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities?,"Petroleum and natural gas system facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. This reporting obligation encompasses onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, natural gas processing, and onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities. The emissions data for these sources must be quality assured as applicable. The emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions have been provided, including population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and methane emission factors for different survey methods and equipment types. This comprehensive data enables accurate reporting and monitoring of emissions from petroleum and natural gas system facilities.","Petroleum and natural gas system facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

26,Does the current GHGRP data include all U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems?,"The current GHGRP data includes emissions from various components of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems such as gathering and boosting equipment, natural gas processing, production equipment, and more. The emissions reported include CO2, CH4, and N2O from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. Therefore, the current GHGRP data does include U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems. Additionally, the provided tables contain default emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, as well as natural gas processing and distribution. These factors include emission rates for different components and regions, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic devices. The tables also provide population emission factors for various equipment and components related to natural gas transmission compression, underground gas storage, LNG storage, and natural gas distribution. However, the formula analysis indicates the presence of incomplete and unclear equations related to emissions calculations, which may require further context or clarification for comprehensive understanding.","The current GHGRP data includes emissions from various components of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems such as gathering and boosting equipment, natural gas processing, production equipment, and more.

It also correctly states that facilities were required to discontinue using BAMM after these periods and follow all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements. Finally, it correctly notes that requests for extension of the use of BAMM beyond specified dates were subject to approval based on unique and extreme circumstances related to safety, technical infeasibility, or inconsistency with other regulations, and that the use of BAMM did not extend beyond the approved periods.",3,0.384,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of how the use of BAMM affected emissions.

This includes adherence to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities as set forth in 30 CFR 250. Additionally, any supplier of petroleum products meeting the specified requirements must report GHG emissions. Facilities are required to report emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, as specified in § 98.232(j). Similarly, emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment must be reported only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, as specified in § 98.232(c). Refiners are also mandated to report CO2 emissions resulting from the complete combustion or oxidation of any biomass co-processed with petroleum feedstocks.'}","The GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas emissions sources must be quality assured as applicable as specified in this section. Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities shall adhere to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements as set forth in 30 CFR 250.

involve reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions. The facility must also report the total annual oil/condensate throughput sent to all atmospheric tanks in the basin, in barrels. Additionally, the facility needs to indicate whether any associated gas was vented or flared during the calendar year. The reporting should be done for each major equipment type, production type, and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C to Subpart W, as well as for each emission source type required to use Equation W–32A. Therefore, the notification requirements are comprehensive and involve reporting various emissions and throughput data.{

34,"How do I determine ""actual"" temperature and pressure in emission calculations?","{'answer': 'To determine the actual temperature and pressure in emission calculations, you must use existing process flow meters and N2O analyzers to measure the amount of process N2O emissions. Additionally, you must determine the temperature and pressure in the biogas that is collected and routed to a destruction device at least once each calendar week. The accuracy of temperature, pressure, and moisture content monitors must be ensured by calibration using specified procedures and frequencies. Furthermore, you may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a fab-specific engineering model and direct measurement to determine emissions. Therefore, the actual temperature and pressure can be determined through regular monitoring and calibration of instrumentation as per the specified procedures. In addition, various emission factors and population emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities, as well as crude oil production equipment, natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage are available for reference in emission calculations.'}","To determine the actual temperature and pressure in emission calculations, you must use existing process flow meters and N2O analyzers to measure the amount of process N2O emissions.

35,What are the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available?,"When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations, annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b). This applies to various scenarios such as onshore natural gas processing facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. Additionally, for gaseous fuels other than natural gas, such as process gas, daily sampling and analysis are required if continuous, on-line equipment is in place to make these measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed. In addition, the default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities vary based on the components and material types. The average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment are also provided, along with the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. Furthermore, leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and population emission factors for various scenarios such as onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage are available for reference in emission calculations.","When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations, annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b).

36,What are the requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare?,"The requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare include: annual volume of flare gas combusted during normal operations from company records (MMscf/year), volume of flare gas combusted during measurement period (scf), and the average higher heating value of the flare gas. Additionally, the calculation method for flare stack emissions and the use of continuous flow measurement devices on the flare are also specified. The emission factors and component counts for various equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as natural gas processing and transmission compression, are also provided. These factors and counts are essential for accurately estimating the volume of gas sent to a flare and for complying with emission regulations. The data also includes specific emission factors for different survey methods, such as § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7), which are crucial for calculating the total hydrocarbon emissions. The information is further categorized based on geographical designations, such as Eastern and Western U.S., to provide a comprehensive understanding of the requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare.","The requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare include: annual volume of flare gas combusted during normal operations from company records (MMscf/year), volume of flare gas combusted during measurement period (scf), and the average higher heating value of the flare gas.

39,How does this final rule relate to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program?,"The final rule specifies that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Additionally, the rule requires quality assurance of GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas emissions sources, with specific monitoring and QA/QC requirements for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. Therefore, the final rule directly relates to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program by outlining the reporting and quality assurance requirements for GHG emissions from natural gas distribution and production facilities. The provided tables contain data related to emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and services in the petroleum and natural gas industry, which can be used to assess and monitor emissions as part of the Natural Gas STAR program.","The final rule specifies that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment only if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

41,How do I determine applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources?,"To determine the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, you must report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), except for flares. This includes combustion units such as boilers, process heaters, and other miscellaneous combustion sources. Additionally, onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities have specific reporting requirements for stationary and portable combustion emissions as specified in paragraphs (c), (j), and (i) respectively. Therefore, based on the specific requirements outlined in the regulations, the determination of applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources depends on the type of facility and the nature of the combustion sources present. The provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These tables can be used to calculate and report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the stationary combustion sources at Subpart W facilities, as required by the regulations.","To determine the applicability for Subpart W facilities with stationary combustion sources, you must report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), except for flares.

It also correctly notes that onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities have specific reporting requirements for stationary and portable combustion emissions.

42,Does the final rule amending 40 CFR Part 98 apply to both onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"Yes, the final rule amending 40 CFR Part 98 applies to both onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production. The rule encompasses all equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, including compressors, generators, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, flares, separation and processing equipment, and portable non-self-propelled equipment used in the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas. It also includes equipment on or associated with a single enhanced oil recovery (EOR) well pad using CO2 or natural gas injection. Additionally, offshore petroleum and natural gas production includes platform structures affixed temporarily or permanently to offshore submerged lands, secondary platform structures, storage tanks, and floating production and storage offloading equipment (FPSO). The emission factors and component counts provided in the tables further support the applicability of the rule to both onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production, as they cover regions in both Eastern and Western U.S. and include various components and equipment related to production and gathering. The default whole gas leaker emission factors and total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground gas storage also indicate the comprehensive coverage of the rule across different stages and processes of petroleum and natural gas production.","Yes, the final rule amending 40 CFR Part 98 applies to both onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production.

The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, addressing all important aspects of the context and question. It also includes additional relevant information about the regulations and equations used to calculate GHG emissions, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the topic.",5,"The answer provides clear and accurate information that is logically entailed by the context. The offshore facility emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources, which exceeds the threshold for reporting GHG emissions. Additionally, the regulations specify that facilities must report emissions if they emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year from stationary fuel combustion sources, which is applicable in this case. The provided information supports the conclusion that the offshore facility would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011.",3,0.3746031746,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise response to the question. It includes relevant information about the emissions from subpart W sources and stationary combustion sources, and explains why the facility would be required to report GHG emissions. Additionally, it mentions the Equation W-2 of §98.233 for calculating CH4 and CO2 volumetric emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting, and refers to the provided tables for population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, crude oil production equipment, and designation of Eastern and Western U.S. These details demonstrate a good understanding of the topic and contribute to the coherence of the answer.",968,

The regulations state that offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction shall report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in the data collection and emissions estimation study published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 (GOADS). Therefore, the 2011 BOEMRE data is suitable for reporting RY2011 emissions. Additionally, the default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting are provided for both Eastern and Western U.S. These factors include population emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and more. Furthermore, the default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment are available for both Eastern and Western U.S. The average component counts cover equipment such as wellheads, separators, meters/piping, compressors, in-line heaters, and dehydrators. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also provided. Additionally, the default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage are available, along with the associated survey methods and components. Finally, various equations are provided for calculating fuel-specific CO2 emission factors, annual emissions, N2O mass emissions, PFC compound emissions, and more, which can be used for emissions reporting and analysis.","Yes, the 2011 BOEMRE data can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility.

It explicitly states that offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities are required to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C, even if they are located farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act. The answer also provides the basis for this reporting requirement, which is the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304.

49,By when do onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report?,"Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities are required to report specific information for each major equipment type, production type, and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C to CFR 98 Subpart W. This reporting includes the use of methodology in § 98.233(r) for calculating equipment leak emissions. Additionally, offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction must report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE, while offshore production facilities not under BOEMRE jurisdiction must use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE. The reported information should align with the relevant monitoring and calculation methods as per the regulations. Furthermore, the equations provided offer insights into the calculation of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, calibration error, high heat value of fuel, emission factors, N2O emission factors, and other relevant factors for accurate reporting. The emission factors and average component counts for different regions and equipment types further support the reporting requirements by providing specific data for emissions and equipment counts in different scenarios.","Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities must report the information specified in paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, for each major equipment type, production type (i.e., natural gas or crude oil), and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C to this subpart for which equipment leak emissions are calculated using the methodology in § 98.233(r). Offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction shall report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in data collection and emissions estimation study published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 (GOADS). Offshore production facilities that are not under BOEMRE jurisdiction must use the most recent monitoring methods and calculation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 250.304 to calculate and report annual emissions (GOADS). Therefore, onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report the specified information for each major equipment type, production type, and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C, and follow the relevant monitoring and calculation methods as per the regulations.{

Since published GOADS data are not available, offshore facilities should not use the GOADS methodologies to calculate the emissions. Instead, they should use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods. Onshore facilities have specific emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services, which should be considered for reporting. Additionally, there are specific emission factors for different survey methods and components related to onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground gas storage, and LNG storage. The provided tables contain detailed default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services in the Eastern and Western U.S., which can be used as a reference for emissions estimation and reporting.","Offshore facilities subject to GOADS should use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE to calculate and report annual emissions.

58,"For an onshore natural gas production facility for which I reported stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for RY2010 and for which I will be reporting under subpart W for RY2011, do I need to make any changes to my RY2010 report?","{'answer': 'For the onshore natural gas production facility, changes to the RY2010 report are necessary to comply with the new reporting requirements under subpart W for RY2011. This is because the emissions from stationary combustion sources at the facility were reported under subpart C for RY2010, but for RY2011, the emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment will be reported under subpart W according to the requirements specified in § 98.236(z). Additionally, the equation W-2 is used to calculate CH4 and CO2 volumetric emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting, taking into account parameters such as Es,i, Count, EF, GHGi, and T. The default value for T is 8,760 hours, and the concentration of GHGi is assumed to be 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2. The pneumatic device emissions calculation resulted in 31,041,060 scf CH4 and 326,748 scf CO2. Furthermore, various tables provide population emission factors, average component counts, leaker emission factors, and population emission factors for different equipment and services related to onshore natural gas production and gathering facilities.'}","For an onshore natural gas production facility, the emissions from fuel combusted in stationary or portable equipment will be reported according to the requirements specified in § 98.236(z) and not according to the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part. Therefore, for RY2010, the emissions from stationary combustion sources at the onshore natural gas production facility were reported under subpart C. However, for RY2011, the emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment at the onshore natural gas production facility will be reported under subpart W according to the requirements specified in § 98.236(z). Therefore, changes to the RY2010 report are necessary to comply with the new reporting requirements under subpart W for RY2011.{

61,Are geologic provinces 160 and 160A one basin or separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"For the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, geologic provinces 160 and 160A would be considered separate basins. The definition of a facility includes all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad in a single hydrocarbon basin. Therefore, since geologic provinces 160 and 160A are distinct basins as per the definition, they would be considered separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. Additionally, the provided tables offer detailed information on emission factors, component counts, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S., which can be valuable for understanding the specific equipment and factors involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas production in these regions.","For the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, geologic provinces 160 and 160A would be considered separate basins.

}",Geologic provinces 160 (Appalachian Basin) and 160A (Appalachian Basin-Eastern Overthrust area) are two distinct basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production under Part 98.,,,5,"The answer provides a clear and logical explanation that geologic provinces 160 and 160A would be considered separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, based on the definition of a facility and the fact that they are distinct basins. The additional information provided in the tables is also relevant and helpful for understanding the specific equipment and factors involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas production in the Eastern and Western U.S. regions.",5,0.2916666667,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and all sentences fit together naturally.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to monitor and regulate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. This reporting is essential for tracking and managing greenhouse gas emissions from the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas. The reporting also includes associated storage or measurement vessels, as well as equipment used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations using CO2 or natural gas injection. The requirement aims to ensure comprehensive monitoring and control of emissions from all equipment and activities associated with onshore petroleum and natural gas production, including gathering and boosting facilities, natural gas transmission compression, and natural gas processing. The EPA mandates reporting of emissions from specific source types, such as compressors, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares, in order to enforce environmental regulations and mitigate the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Additionally, the EPA's requirement takes into account population emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and specific emission factors for different components and services, ensuring a detailed and comprehensive approach to emissions monitoring and regulation.","The EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin in order to monitor and regulate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

It mentions that the reporting is essential for tracking and managing greenhouse gas emissions from the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas, and includes associated storage or measurement vessels, as well as equipment used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations using CO2 or natural gas injection. The answer also mentions that the EPA mandates reporting of emissions from specific source types, such as compressors, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares, in order to enforce environmental regulations and mitigate the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Overall, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",3,0.3151125402,1,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of why the EPA required facilities to report by basin, including the specific emissions being monitored and the equipment and activities being regulated. There is no uncertainty or lack of knowledge conveyed in the answer.",5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent, providing a clear and comprehensive explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. The answer covers all the necessary details, including the types of emissions being monitored, the equipment and activities being regulated, and the specific source types that must be reported. The answer also mentions the use of population emission factors, average component counts, and specific emission factors for different components and services, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the topic. Overall, the answer is highly coherent and provides a complete and accurate explanation of the EPA's reporting requirement.",1459,

Therefore, the optional delayed reporting requirements for wildcat wells and delineation wells include GOR and volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production. Additionally, the analysis provides detailed information on emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. It also includes data on leaker emission factors, total hydrocarbon emission factors, and methane emission factors for various equipment and facilities related to natural gas production and storage. The equations provided are related to emission calculations and factors for different gases and processes, which can be utilized for emissions monitoring and compliance purposes.","For wildcat wells and delineation wells, the reporting of Gas to Oil Ratio (GOR) and Volume of Oil produced during the first 30 days of production can be delayed if indicated in the annual report.

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, you must calculate the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. The GOR can be determined from available data using procedures specified in the regulations. If GOR cannot be determined from available data, specific procedures outlined in the regulations must be followed to determine the GOR. Therefore, the GOR for gathering pipelines can be calculated based on the available data and by following the specified procedures. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for gathering pipelines and natural gas equipment, which can be used in conjunction with the specified procedures to calculate the GOR.","To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, you must calculate the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure.

}","The gathering and boosting system owner or operator can use a direct measurement of GOR through either onsite measurement or by sending samples out for laboratory analysis. The timing and duration of the sampling/measurement program should follow existing regulatory requirements, which include standard methods published by a consensus-based standards organization or industry standard practices. See 40 CFR 98.234(b). The EPA realizes that owners or operators may calculate GOR for other reasons such as documenting fluid quality for financial transactions, equipment optimization or other state/federal reporting requirements. These values can be used where appropriate.A825. 40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W does not prescribe a specific approach to calculate GOR. Gathering and boosting system operators may use the best approach for their facility, including direct measurement, calculation from other measured data, and standard estimation measures. We note that within the EPA’s 2016 updates to New Source Performance Standards for the oil and natural gas sector, GOR is defined as the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to a standard temperature and pressure. See 40 CFR 60.5430a.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how to determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, including the use of available data and specified procedures.

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific sources as outlined in the regulations. These sources include equipment such as centrifugal compressors, blowdown vent stacks, stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment, valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, low continuous bleed pneumatic device vents, high continuous bleed pneumatic device vents, intermittent bleed pneumatic device vents, and pneumatic pumps. The emission factors for these components vary based on factors such as gas service, crude service, material type, and survey methods. The emission factors are measured in standard cubic feet per hour per component and are used to calculate the total vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing.","Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the following sources as specified in the applicable paragraphs of the regulations. This includes reporting emissions from equipment/activities such as centrifugal compressors, blowdown vent stacks, and stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. Therefore, vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific sources as outlined in the regulations.{

}","If a membrane unit is used to remove CO2 from natural gas containing concentrations of hydrogen sulfide or carbon dioxide that exceed the concentrations specified for commercially saleable nature gas, then emissions must be calculated and reported as specified in §98.233 (d), as this process meets the definition of acid gas removal unit in §98.238.  Please see EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1298-18 in the Response To Comments (1719 - 1720) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf for further details on the definitions of sweet and sour gas.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate description of where vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported, including the specific sources outlined in the regulations and the equipment/components that are included in the reporting. The answer also mentions the factors that affect the emission factors and how they are measured. Overall, the answer addresses all the important aspects of the question and provides a clear and complete explanation, earning a rating of five stars for relevance.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate statement that vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from specific sources as outlined in the regulations. The answer also lists the equipment/components from which emissions are reported, which includes centrifugal compressors, blowdown vent stacks, stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment, valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, low continuous bleed pneumatic device vents, high continuous bleed pneumatic device vents, intermittent bleed pneumatic device vents, and pneumatic pumps. The answer also mentions that the emission factors for these components vary based on factors such as gas service, crude service, material type, and survey methods, and that the emission factors are measured in standard cubic feet per hour per component and are used to calculate the total vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing. Therefore, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",2,0.218579235,1,The answer provides a clear and complete response to the question without any uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise explanation of where vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported. It also lists the specific sources from which these emissions are reported and provides information on the emission factors for various components. However, there are a few instances where the answer could have been more coherent, such as when listing the sources of vent emissions.",806,

It primarily focuses on the retention of records and the use of industry standard practices. Therefore, the specific capacity designation would likely be found in a different section or regulation. The provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. However, they do not directly address the designation of 25 mmscf per day as the design or actual capacity for a processing plant.","The section § 98.230(a)(3) does not directly specify whether 25 mmscf per day is the design capacity or the actual capacity for a processing plant.

The provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing.

74,"If a natural gas processing plant is co-located with an underground storage facility and they share compression, can they report as one combined facility?","Yes, a natural gas processing plant co-located with an underground storage facility and sharing compression can report as one combined facility. The onshore natural gas processing segment includes processing plants that fractionate gas liquids and processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. Additionally, the underground natural gas storage segment includes compression, dehydration, and flow measurement, and all the wellheads connected to the compression units located at the facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs. The emission factors and component counts for major equipment in both the Eastern and Western U.S. are provided, along with leaker emission factors for various components. This information can be used to assess and report the combined emissions from the co-located facilities. The emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression, as well as underground natural gas storage, are also available for calculating the total hydrocarbon emissions from the combined facility.","Yes, a natural gas processing plant co-located with an underground storage facility and sharing compression can report as one combined facility.

}",EPA has reviewed your question and is unable to respond at this time.  Your question relates to an issue or issues currently the subject of ongoing litigation.  Please monitor the website for any additional guidance that may be available in the future. http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/reporters/subpart/w.html,,,5,The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It explicitly states that facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W regulations. The additional information provided in the emission factor tables and component counts for major equipment further supports this conclusion.,2,0.1636363636,1,The answer provides a clear and confident response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the regulatory implications for facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams. It also references the emission factor tables and component counts for major equipment to further support the argument. The sentences flow logically and coherently, making the answer easy to understand and follow.",524,
78,How should I calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids?,"To calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater should be considered. This annual average throughput serves as the reporting threshold for such onshore natural gas processing plants. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and average component counts for major equipment, which can be used for further analysis and compliance with reporting requirements.","To calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, you should consider the annual average throughput. According to the provided information, onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in the industry segment. Therefore, the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day serves as the reporting threshold for such onshore natural gas processing plants.{

}","The Rule states in §98.230(a) that the onshore natural gas processing industry includes all plants that fractionate, as well as all plants that do not fractionate that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.  Only those non-fractionating facilities with an annual average throughput of less than 25 MMscf per day would not be subject to reporting under subpart W even if the reporting threshold is triggered in Subpart C.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how to calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids, and also mentions the availability of additional information in the provided tables for compliance with reporting requirements.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by stating that the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids is the annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.

79,What is the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often must a facility re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold?,"The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is that onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in this industry segment. As for how often a facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold, the regulation does not explicitly specify a frequency for re-evaluation. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing. These tables offer detailed information that can be used for emissions calculations and compliance assessments in the natural gas industry.","The basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is that onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in this industry segment.

The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",4,"The answer correctly states that the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) is that onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater are included in this industry segment. The answer also correctly states that the regulation does not explicitly specify a frequency for re-evaluation. However, the answer includes additional information about emission factors and component counts for various equipment and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, which is not directly relevant to the question. Therefore, the answer is mostly relevant and deserves a rating of four stars.",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and also acknowledges that the regulation does not specify a frequency for re-evaluation. The answer also mentions the availability of detailed information in the provided tables for emissions calculations and compliance assessments in the natural gas industry.,3,0.3342776204,1,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold and also addresses the frequency of re-evaluation, even though it is not explicitly specified in the regulation.",4,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3).

Therefore, both the emission threshold and the throughput are crucial factors in determining the applicability of Subpart W to a natural gas processing facility.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,No answer found,No context found,"The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question and provides no information related to the methods for monitoring tank emissions or the treatment of intermittent emissions from storage tanks.,1,"The answer is not found, therefore it is not possible to determine whether it is true or false without further information.",1,0.0,5,"The answer straightforwardly states that no answer was found, and makes no attempt to answer the question.",1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the given question.,15,

Furthermore, the default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment have been outlined. The emission factors for onshore natural gas processing, transmission compression, and underground natural gas storage have also been detailed. Additionally, the population emission factors for LNG storage and underground natural gas storage have been included. Therefore, the data provides comprehensive information that can be utilized to assess and report emissions from the transmission storage tank vent stack to a flare, as well as potential scrubber dump valve leakage and reporting requirements.","Based on the information provided, it is indicated that the transmission storage tank vent stack may be connected to a flare. Additionally, if the storage tank receiving the separator oil is sent to a flare and scrubber dump valve leakage occurred for the transmission storage tank vent stack, then specific information must be reported. Therefore, it is possible for the storage tank to be sent to a flare, and if certain conditions are met, reporting to the flare is required.{

This is supported by the table analysis which provides emission factors and component counts for various equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The tables specify the emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves, indicating the components that require leak checks. Additionally, the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. does not directly relate to the requirement for leak checks in condensate tanks, and the formula analysis pertains to environmental and chemical calculations unrelated to the specific question.","Yes, only condensate tanks at the facilities require leak checks in the natural gas transmission segment.{
    ""result"": ""The provided input contains a large number of LaTeX equations and their explanations. However, the equations are not coherent and seem to be fragmented. It appears that the equations are related to various environmental and chemical calculations, such as emissions factors, stoichiometric ratios, and combustion efficiencies. The equations also involve factors such as molecular weights, conversion factors, and inventory calculations. It seems that these equations are part of a larger set of calculations related to environmental reporting and compliance. However, due to the fragmented nature of the input, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive analysis of the individual equations and their context.""

combination of compressors that move natural gas from production fields, natural gas processing plants, or other transmission compressors through transmission pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage. It also includes equipment for liquids separation, and tanks for the storage of water and hydrocarbon liquids. Therefore, the definition encompasses the movement of natural gas at elevated pressure as part of the compression process.{

89,How does a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability?,"The determination of subpart applicability for a natural gas compressor station involves detailed reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the specified equipment, along with the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors. The station must also report the quantities specified in the relevant regulations for each type of equipment. Additionally, the station needs to consider the average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. The default whole gas emission factors for different components in the Eastern and Western U.S. provide important data for emission calculations. Furthermore, the default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression, along with population emission factors, are crucial for determining subpart applicability. The designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states is also relevant for regulatory compliance. Overall, the determination of subpart applicability involves a comprehensive assessment of emissions, quantities, and factors as per the specified regulations and regional designations.","For a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator, the determination of subpart applicability involves reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the equipment specified in the applicable paragraphs of the regulations. The station must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service. Additionally, the station must report the quantities specified in the relevant paragraphs of the regulations for each type of equipment. Therefore, the determination of subpart applicability involves detailed reporting of emissions and quantities as per the specified regulations.{

See response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-19, Response To Comments (1610 - 1611) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf for further details.",,,5,The answer directly states that CO2 pipelines are subject to the Onshore natural gas transmission compression segment under 40 CFR 98 subpart W and that reporting of CO2 and CH4 emissions from blowdown vent stacks is required for onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities. This information logically follows from the given context.,1,0.2222222222,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,,,572,
91,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"Unintentional natural gas releases, including those resulting from accidental releases, are indeed subject to reporting. The text analysis indicates that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, highlighting the requirement for reporting unintentional natural gas releases. Additionally, the table analysis provides emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as for underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and import/export equipment. These emission factors are crucial for quantifying and reporting unintentional natural gas releases as part of regulatory compliance.","Yes, unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases are subject to reporting. The text mentions the intentional or designed releases of CH4 or CO2 containing natural gas, but it also specifies that vented emissions include process designed flow to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes, equipment blowdown for maintenance, and direct venting of gas used to power equipment. Additionally, it states that facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, indicating the requirement for reporting unintentional natural gas releases.{

","Onshore natural gas transmission pipeline facilities must report emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from blowdown vent stacks to the GHGRP if facility-wide annual emissions are 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO2e) or greater. This requirement applies to blowdown vent stack emissions from the depressurization of equipment for both planned and emergency shutdowns.",,,5,"The context clearly states that unintentional natural gas releases, including those resulting from accidental releases, are subject to reporting. The answer accurately summarizes this information and provides additional details about the reporting requirements and the importance of emission factors for regulatory compliance.",5,0.2911392405,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is highly coherent and provides a clear and accurate response to the question. It not only confirms that unintentional natural gas releases are subject to reporting, but also provides additional information on the reporting requirements and the importance of emission factors in quantifying and reporting these releases. The answer is well-structured and all the sentences fit together naturally, making it easy to understand and follow.",807,
92,How do we report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir?,"To report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir, several factors need to be considered. Firstly, the facility must report CO2 and methane emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions. Secondly, appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service must be used. Additionally, the facility must report the specified quantities for underground natural gas storage facilities and indicate whether any equipment components are subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards. Furthermore, Equation W–30 and default methane leaker emission factors for transmission-distribution transfer station components should be used to calculate component emissions from annual equipment leak surveys. The emission factors for different components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S. are provided in the tables, including population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and methane emission factors. These factors are essential for accurately reporting emissions from separate facilities injecting or withdrawing gas from the same underground storage reservoir.","To report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir, the following factors need to be considered: 1. The facility must report CO2 and methane emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions. 2. The facility must use appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service. 3.

The facility must use Equation W–30 and default methane leaker emission factors for transmission-distribution transfer station components to calculate component emissions from annual equipment leak surveys. Based on these requirements, emissions from separate facilities injecting or withdrawing gas from the same underground storage reservoir can be accurately reported.{

","Underground storage and compression and transmission compression are two separate industry segments.  A “facility”, as defined in 40 CFR 98.6, must determine if it contains any of the industry segments listed in subpart W and compare its emissions from all applicable industry segments against the 25,000 mtCO2e threshold defined in 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2) to determine applicability.  For a response to the question related to multipurpose facilities and dual purpose equipment, please see the response to EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (see pp. 1606-1608 in http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf).  If multiple owners or operators use the same underground storage operation, one designated representative must be appointed for reporting purposes.",5,"The answer addresses all the important aspects of the question based on the context. It provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the factors that need to be considered when reporting emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir. The answer also mentions the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors, Equation W-30, and default methane leaker emission factors for transmission-distribution transfer station components to calculate component emissions from annual equipment leak surveys. Additionally, the answer refers to the provided tables that contain essential emission factors for accurately reporting emissions from separate facilities injecting or withdrawing gas from the same underground storage reservoir.",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the factors that need to be considered when reporting emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir.

93,Could EPA clarify that the natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W?,"Based on the information provided, the natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W. The emission factors and component counts provided for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as onshore natural gas transmission compression, support the distinction between high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations and underground natural gas storage facilities. The data on leaker emission factors and population emission factors further emphasize the differences in emissions between the two types of facilities. Therefore, it is clear that the natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations falls outside the scope of an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W.","The natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should NOT be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W.{

The regulations specify reporting requirements for underground natural gas storage facilities, including the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage wellheads. Additionally, the data on average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment further supports the need for separate emission reports based on operational responsibilities. Therefore, each operator should submit separate emission reports based on their respective ownership and operational responsibilities.","Yes, the respective operators of the underground storage facility and the associated storage wellheads jointly owned and operated by two companies should submit separate emission reports. The regulations specify reporting requirements for underground natural gas storage facilities, including the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage wellheads, and the reporting of specific quantities for underground natural gas storage. Therefore, each operator should submit separate emission reports based on their respective ownership and operational responsibilities.{

96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"The reason natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment is because the regulations specify the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service. These emission factors are listed in Table W–4A and Table W–4B to this subpart. Therefore, the regulations do not differentiate between compressor and non-compressor components when it comes to emission factors for natural gas storage facilities. The emission factors for storage stations and storage wellheads are provided in the tables, indicating specific factors for different components based on the survey methods used, but they do not distinguish between compressor and non-compressor components.","The reason natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment is because the regulations specify the use of appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations or storage wellheads in gas service.

The reporting includes CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources such as degasification systems, natural gas processing, storage tanks vented emissions, and injection of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery. Therefore, reporting starts from the salt dome mining process and continues throughout the operations for load balancing or storage. The provided tables and equations contain information related to emission factors, component counts, and survey methods for various gas and crude oil production and processing equipment.

                   ","What constitutes a facility, how to determine the reporting threshold, and reporting of emissions from collocated and dual purpose equipment is as follows: 1) As a first step the reporter must determine the emissions from all equipment listed in 98.232(c) for onshore petroleum and production.  Per section 98.231(a) only sources listed in 98.232(c) need to be considered for threshold determination for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. 98.238 defines “facility” for the purposes of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems.  Per the requirements of 98.3 each “facility” must submit a GHG report for all source categories at that “facility”.  2) Note that while identifying onshore production emissions sources reporters have to determine whether the source is “on the well pad or associated with a well pad”.  The location of production wells within other facilities is inconsequential to this determination.  Sources on a well pad or associated with a well pad across the entire reporting basin have to be taken into consideration.  If your emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production are equal to or greater than 25,000mtCO2e, then onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities report as a separate facility and include all emissions sources listed in 98.232(c).  3) Except for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution, which have unique facility definitions, all other segments subject to subpart W are considered in the threshold determination for a single facility.  You would also include emissions from other source categories at your facility (e.g., stationary combustion).  If there are emissions sources that are dual purpose then the rule requires this piece of equipment to be reported under the majority use industry segment based on guidance provided in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (pp. 1606-1608).  4) For collocated industry segments, which cannot occur in the case of onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution due to the requirements in 98.231(a), EPA has provided guidance on emissions reporting in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14.  Based on the information provided, the facility cannot be reported as onshore production and natural gas processing combined (see point 1 above).  For all the other segments, the report should use guidance in points 2-3 above to determine the segment under which the facility should be categorized.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate summary of the reporting requirements for a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recovery and storage, as well as the emission factors and component counts for various equipment and sources. The answer is highly relevant to the given context and question, and covers all the important aspects.",5,"The context clearly states that a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recovery and storage should report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions. Additionally, they should report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary and portable fuel combustion sources in the onshore production industry segment. The facility should also consider reporting emissions from stationary combustion sources in the natural gas distribution industry segment and all other applicable stationary combustion sources. The emissions data for petroleum and natural gas emissions sources must be quality assured as applicable as specified in the regulations. Therefore, accurate reporting of emissions from various sources as per the specified guidelines is necessary.",1,0.096969697,,,4,"The answer provides clear and accurate information on the reporting requirements for a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage. The answer also includes relevant emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment. However, the answer could be more coherent by organizing the information in a more structured and logical manner.",8477,

The context clearly states that dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility.

Additionally, the table analysis provides data on emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, further supporting the inclusion of dehydration units within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility.",1,0.1587301587,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent.

}","LNG facilities will not be surveying the valves, connectors, and other components that are in Gas Service under 98.233(q).  At an LNG facility, a compressor that recovers vapor, but is designed so that it does not have reportable emissions of methane-containing gas, such as a flooded screw compressor, or one with seals purged with pressurized nitrogen, will not be reported, in accordance with the rule and the EPA’s response in Response to Public Comments, EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1026-7 (see pp. 45-46 in http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part1.pdf).  Vapor recovery compressors use a population emission factor, hence there is no leak detection required.  Reporters have to count the number of vapor recovery compressors and use the population emission factor.",5,"The answer directly addresses the question and provides the correct information. It states that only the equipment listed in Table W-5 (Vapor Recovery Compressor) is required to be reported if it is found to be leaking as defined in the rule, which is exactly what the question is asking.

102,Do I have to calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals?,"Yes, you must calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals. The regulations specify the need to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources including LNG storage, LNG import and export equipment, and well venting for liquids unloading. The annual volume in Mscf of natural gas withdrawn from on-system storage and annual volume in Mscf of vaporized LNG withdrawn from storage for delivery on the distribution system are also important factors to consider. Additionally, the provided tables contain population emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting equipment, as well as average component counts for major equipment in natural gas production and crude oil production. These factors can be used to calculate and report emissions effectively.","Yes, you must calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals.

A pressure relief valve is a special type of valve and falls in the category of ""other,"" so this emission source is included in the leak detection survey and required to be reported.  Regarding your first question: sections 98.232(g) and 98.232(h) do no include venting from LNG storage tanks as an emission source; therefore venting emissions from LNG storage tank are not required for LNG storage or for LNG import and export equipment.  However, if the LNG storge tank is blown down to atmosphere, then section 98.232(h) does require reporting.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question, stating that emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals must be calculated. The answer also provides additional information about the need to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources, as well as important factors to consider when calculating emissions.

There is no uncertainty or lack of knowledge conveyed in the answer.",4,"The answer is mostly coherent and provides relevant information about the environmental terms and activities related to offshore LNG terminals, as well as the regulations and emission factors that apply to this scenario.",1160,
104,"Is an LNG Storage vessel considered ""above ground"" if any portion of the vessel is above grade?","Yes, an LNG storage vessel is considered 'above ground' if any portion of the vessel is above grade, as per the definition provided in the regulations. Additionally, the emission factors for various components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment have been provided for both Eastern and Western U.S. locations. The average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as crude oil production equipment, have also been detailed. Furthermore, emission factors for leakers and total hydrocarbon emission factors for different equipment and services have been included. The methane population emission factors for LNG storage and leaker emission factors for LNG import and export equipment have also been outlined.","Yes, an LNG storage vessel is considered 'above ground' if any portion of the vessel is above grade, as per the definition provided in the regulations.{

105,"At LNG Storage sites, how should pumps that are internal and submerged be treated?","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated by reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks. It is important to use appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components to accurately assess the environmental impact. Additionally, compliance with the regulations specified in the applicable paragraphs of the environmental regulations must be ensured. The default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components are as follows: Valve (Survey Method 1-6): 14.84, Valve (Survey Method 21): 9.51; Connector (Survey Method 1-6): 5.59, Connector (Survey Method 21): 3.58; Open-Ended Line (Survey Method 1-6): 17.27, Open-Ended Line (Survey Method 21): 11.07; Pressure Relief Valve (Survey Method 1-6): 39.66, Pressure Relief Valve (Survey Method 21): 25.42; Meter and Instrument (Survey Method 1-6): 19.33, Meter and Instrument (Survey Method 21): 12.39. These factors should be utilized for accurate assessment and mitigation of emissions.","At LNG storage sites, pumps that are internal and submerged should be treated by reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, using appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components, and ensuring compliance with the regulations specified in the applicable paragraphs of the environmental regulations.{

                        ""Intermittent Bleed Pneumatic Device V","For natural gas distribution, a facility, which is the collection of all distribution pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by an LDC, is required to do at least one facility wide leak detection survey per calendar year and has the option to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys; if the facility selects this option, the additional facility-wide survey(s) must be completed during the same calendar year in order to account for fixing one or more leaks in the annual GHG report.  If the facility chooses to fix one or more leaks and conduct another survey to determine that the component is not leaking, it must conduct a facility wide leak detection survey in order to account for fixing the leak(s) in the annual GHG report.  As leaks are random in nature and while some leaks are fixed others are likely to occur.  Therefore, a comprehensive survey is the only statistically relevant manner by which to establish facility-wide leak emissions rates and account for leaks repaired.  Please see the response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1014-9 (Response to Comments, pp. 1281-1282, http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf) for further details.  It is very important to note that the requirement to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys should a company wish to account for fixing a leak does not preclude in any way a company from repairing a leak.  If a company chooses to conduct only one facility-wide leak detection survey in a calendar year but finds a leak during the survey, the company can and is encouraged to fix the leak.  The leak detected though, as noted above, must be reported as a leaker for the entire calendar year should the company choose not to conduct a second survey.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year. If a facility chooses to conduct multiple surveys, the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions. Additionally, the facility must report the number of years in the leak survey cycle if conducting surveys across multiple years, not exceeding a five-year period. The answer also mentions the availability of emission factors and component counts in the provided tables, which can be used to calculate emissions from the surveys.",2,0.2774566474,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it clearly states that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year and if a facility chooses to conduct multiple surveys, the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions. Additionally, the facility must report the number of years in the leak survey cycle if conducting surveys across multiple years, not exceeding a five-year period. The provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services, which can be used to calculate emissions from the surveys. The specific emission factors and component counts can be utilized to determine the frequency and scope of leak detection surveys required for accurate emissions calculation.",694,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"Based on the provided information, the owner or operator of natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period. If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, the number of transmission-distribution transfer stations that are monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle. Therefore, if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components, EPA may consider providing a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required, subject to the approval criteria and timing specified in the regulations. Additionally, the provided emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing can be used to assess and monitor the environmental impact of these operations. The equations provided offer conversion factors and calculations for emissions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact of these activities.","Based on the provided information, the owner or operator of natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period.

            ","Equipment/component leaks are random in nature and minimal leaks in one year do not guarantee similar leak levels in the future.  There are no sunsetting provisions for individual emissions sources, only facilities.  EPA has provided provisions that allow facilities to stop reporting under certain conditions and with prior notification to EPA.  Please see 40 CFR 98.2(i) (1) – (i) (3).  EPA addressed sunset provisions in general in the proposal to the 2009 Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule (74 FR 16478).",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question, citing the information provided in the context. It states that if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components, EPA may consider providing a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required, subject to the approval criteria and timing specified in the regulations.",1,0.1908713693,2,The answer attempts to address the question but conveys some uncertainty by using words like 'may consider' and 'subject to approval criteria and timing specified in the regulations'.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides information on conducting equipment leak surveys at natural gas distribution facilities over multiple years and the possibility of a sunset provision if no leaking components are found. It also mentions the availability of emission factors and equations for assessing the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing.",1221,

Therefore, the monitoring plan is not consistent with the rule language. Additionally, the provided tables contain detailed information on emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, major crude oil production equipment, and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. However, there is no specific information in the tables that directly addresses the consistency of monitoring plans with regulatory rule language.","The rule language states that for natural gas distribution facilities, the number of transmission-distribution transfer stations that are monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle. The monitoring plan that results in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year five is not consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'

We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question, addressing the main aspect of the context and question. It also explicitly states that the monitoring plan is not consistent with the rule language, providing a complete and relevant answer.",1,"The answer clearly states that the monitoring plan is not consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' Therefore, the score is 1.",2,0.3007915567,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,1,"The answer lacks coherence as it provides additional information about emission factors and component counts for various facilities, but does not directly address the consistency of the monitoring plan with the regulatory rule language.",789,

Acoustic leak detection devices are used to detect through-valve leakage, and a leak is detected if a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated. Optical gas imaging instruments are used for inaccessible source types and a leak is designated if 10,000 ppm or greater is detected. Infrared laser beam illuminated instruments also designate a leak if 10,000 ppm or greater is detected.

117,In 98.233.d.8 are we allowed to assume that volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas out of the AGR unit is zero?,"Based on the information provided in the text, the determination of the volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas out of the AGR unit would depend on the specific values and calculations obtained using the methods specified in the regulations. The tables provide emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to natural gas production and gathering. However, there is no direct indication of the volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas out of the AGR unit being zero. Further analysis or specific data from the AGR unit would be required to determine the actual volume fraction of CO2 content in the natural gas.","Based on the information provided in the text, the annual average volumetric fraction of CO2 content in natural gas flowing out of the AGR unit can be determined using the methods specified in paragraphs (d)(8)(i) through (d)(8)(iii) of this section. The specific equations W–4A or W–4B of this subpart can be used to calculate the annual average volumetric fraction of CO2 in the natural gas flowing out of the acid gas removal unit. Therefore, it is not explicitly stated whether the volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas out of the AGR unit is zero. The determination of the volume fraction of CO2 content in natural gas out of the AGR unit would depend on the specific values and calculations obtained using the methods specified in the regulations.{

The provided context also supports this statement by explaining the calculation process and assumptions involved in determining CH4 and CO2 volumetric emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting, as well as the population emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment that contribute to the overall emissions calculation and reduction efforts as required by the regulation.",1,0.3185840708,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise response to the question.

121,For AGR vents is the use of a meter to measure flow rates required?,"Yes, the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required for AGR vents. The text analysis confirms the need to calculate emissions for CO2 vented directly to the atmosphere or emitted through a flare, engine, or sulfur recovery plant using specific calculation methods. It also specifies the need to determine the annual volume of gas vented from the acid gas removal unit in cubic feet and provides various methods for measuring the flow rate, including the installation of a continuous gas analyzer or taking quarterly gas samples for each quarter that the AGR unit is operating. Additionally, the table analysis provides emission factors and component counts for various equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, and boosting, as well as for natural gas distribution. These factors and counts further emphasize the importance of using a meter to measure flow rates for accurate emission calculations and regulatory compliance.","Yes, the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required for AGR vents.

The measurements must be conducted at the specified frequency, and there are specific methods for performing as found measurements and continuous measurements for both centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources. Additionally, the provided table data includes population emission factors for various components in the Eastern and Western U.S., average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and leaker emission factors for different equipment and services.

Additionally, the answer provides relevant information from the provided table data that can be used to further understand and implement the approved Subpart W BAMM.",5,"The context clearly states that EPA approves the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold. The regulations specify that for a compressor source that is part of a manifolded group of compressor sources, combined volumetric emissions from the manifolded group of compressor sources can be measured at the common vent stack. The measurements must be conducted at the specified frequency, and there are specific methods for performing as found measurements and continuous measurements for both centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources. Therefore, the answer is logically true based on the information provided in the context.",2,0.25,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of EPA's approval of Subpart W BAMM for measuring individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold.

130,The emission methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd in the preamble (use flow rate of wet NG and EF) contradict the requirements in the rule (use dehydrator count and EF).,"The emission methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd in the preamble contradict the requirements in the rule. The rule specifies different calculation methods for dehydrator vents based on the daily natural gas throughput. For dehydrators with a daily natural gas throughput greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, the emissions are calculated using Calculation Method 1, which involves using software programs like AspenTech HYSYS® or GRI–GLYCalc TM. On the other hand, for dehydrators with a daily natural gas throughput less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, the emissions are calculated using Calculation Method 2, which involves using Equation W–5 of the section. This indicates a contradiction in the emission calculation methods specified based on the throughput. Additionally, the provided table data includes emission factors and component counts for different equipment and regions, which can be used to calculate emissions based on the specific equipment and location.","The emission methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd in the preamble contradict the requirements in the rule.

","40 CFR § 98.238 defines a flare as “…a combustion device, whether at ground level or elevated, that uses an open or closed flame to combust waste gases without energy recovery.”  An open pipe without combustion would not be considered a flare, but any hydrocarbon releases through it would be considered “vented emissions” under §98.238, which includes “process designed flow to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes.”",,,5,"The answer directly states that a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not count as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W.
