The subpart W allows facilities currently subject to it and acquiring new sources from another facility to use best engineering estimates for data related to the newly acquired sources for the first 6 months if they cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the subpart's requirements. Similarly, facilities that become newly subject to subpart W may also use best engineering estimates for any data that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained for the first 6 months. Additionally, the number of sources of equipment type t with screening values greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv should be determined using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7, with a defined leak as per the method.","The subpart W allows facilities currently subject to it and acquiring new sources from another facility to use best engineering estimates for data related to the newly acquired sources for the first 6 months if they cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the subpart's requirements.

27,What percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP?,"The GHGRP (Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program) requires facilities in the petroleum and natural gas industry to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources. Onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities must report emissions if the emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from all equipment leaks, vented emissions, and flare emissions.

The reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems (subpart W) include specific guidelines for reporting emissions from fuel combusted in stationary or portable equipment at various facilities. Therefore, the percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems reported under the GHGRP depends on the total emissions from these facilities that meet the reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year.","Facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment if emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) has a significant impact on emissions measurement. These methods are employed when the required measurement data cannot reasonably be obtained according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of the subpart.

39,How does this final rule relate to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program?,"The final rule requires the natural gas distribution industry segment to report emissions if the specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. This relates to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program as it aligns with the program's focus on reducing methane emissions from the natural gas industry. Additionally, the rule specifies that GHG emissions data for petroleum and natural gas emissions sources must be quality assured, which is in line with the Natural Gas STAR program's emphasis on promoting the use of cost-effective technologies and practices to reduce methane emissions. The requirement for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities to adhere to monitoring and QA/QC requirements also aligns with the program's goal of reducing methane emissions from oil and natural gas systems. Furthermore, the rule mandates that any supplier of natural gas and natural gas liquids meeting certain requirements must report GHG emissions associated with the products they supply, which is consistent with the Natural Gas STAR program's efforts to improve emission quantification and reporting.

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"The gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines is determined by calculating the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure. The GOR can be calculated for each well tested, and the average GOR can be reported in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil. If the GOR cannot be determined from available data, specific procedures are outlined for measurement. Additionally, the GOR for well venting during well workovers and well completions with hydraulic fracturing is specified to be 300 scf/STB or greater. The GOR can also be reported for an oil sub-basin as the average GOR of all wells in thousand standard cubic feet per barrel. If well production oil and gas compositions are not available, default oil and gas compositions can be used in software programs. Furthermore, the GOR can be determined using Equation W–12C of § 98.233. It is important to note that the GOR is a critical parameter for assessing the hydrocarbon production and associated natural gas emissions.","The gas to oil ratio (GOR) is determined by calculating the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to standard temperature and pressure.

110,Please explain how many leak detection surveys must be conducted a calendar year?  Must a facility indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year?,"At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year. If multiple complete leak detection surveys are conducted in a calendar year, the results from each complete survey must be used when calculating emissions. Natural gas distribution facilities performing equipment leak surveys across a multiple year leak survey cycle must report the number of years in the cycle. They may choose to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all stations. If the facility chooses the multiple year option, the number of stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle. Therefore, while at least one survey must be conducted in a calendar year, the facility may choose to conduct surveys over a multiple year cycle, not exceeding five years, with approximately equal number of stations monitored each year.","At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year.
