9,How are greenhouse gas emissions calculated for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities?,"Greenhouse gas emissions for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities are calculated based on the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from various sources such as equipment leaks, vented emissions, gas flares, and combustion sources. The emissions are estimated using default emission factors provided in tables such as Table W-1A, W-1E, W-2, W-3A, W-4A, W-5A, W-6A, W-7, etc. These tables provide emission factors for different components and equipment based on specified survey methods. The emission factors are used to estimate emissions from leaking and non-leaking components for different services and equipment types. Additionally, population emission factors are provided for different equipment and material types to estimate emissions from the entire population of components. The calculation also considers parameters such as annual total volumetric GHG emissions, total number of pneumatic devices, concentration of GHGs in natural gas, and operational hours of the devices. Specific equations and calculations for each type of device and corresponding emission factors can be found in Tables W-1A, W-3B, and W-4B of subpart W for different types of facilities.","applicable subpart shall take precedence., (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and  ing facilities and natural gas distribution facilities, indicate whether any equipment components at your facility are subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § ) Facilities that meet the definition of petrochemical plants and report under subpart X of this part. ustion unit by following the requirements of subpart C except for facilities under onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and natural g ally-owned distribution system., Facility with respect to natural gas distribution for purposes of reporting under this subpart and for the corresponding subpart A requirements means th natural gas or other production well, and transferred to your facility. ther industry segment defined in this subpart., Facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production for purposes of reporting under this subpart and for the corresponding s storage facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon population emission factors for storage wellheads in gas service listed in Table W–4B to this subpart., (4) LNG storage e facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting operations., (B) Multiply major equipment counts by the average component counts listed in Table W–1B of this subpart fo ts in gas service listed in Table W–3A to this subpart., (vii) Underground natural gas storage facilities must use the appropriate default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage ural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment as specified in § 98.232(d)(2), (e)(2), (f)(2), (g) pressor venting at an onshore petroleum and natural gas production facility as specified in § 98.232(c)(19) or an onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facility as specified in § 98 tural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment as specified in § 98.232(d)(1), (e)(1), (f)(1), (g natural gas and/or fuel oil, is not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input data year-round according to § 75.19 of this chapter but is not required by the applicable part 7 eum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, or natural gas transmission pipelines., (i) Cumulative hours of venting, days, or times of operation in § 98.233(e), (g), (o), (p), and ( atural gas recovery that is covered by subpart UU of this part., (11) Geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that is covered by subpart RR of this part., (12) Research and developmen ified in paragraphs (r)(1)(i) through (v) of this section separately for each emission source type required to use Equation W–32A that is located at your facility.

16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The difference in units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage is due to multiple factors. Text analysis indicates that for onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities, the units used are standard cubic feet of CO2 per operational hour.

Formula analysis further supports this by highlighting the specific characteristics and operational parameters of the equipment in each process, which contribute to the differences in the units used for vented emissions. Therefore, the varying units for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting between transmission compression and underground storage are a result of different survey methods, emission factors, and operational parameters specific to each process.","ural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, and LNG import and export equipment as specified in § 98.232(d)(2), (e)(2), (f)(2), (g) sion pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage.

28,"How does EPA define a ""facility"" for petroleum and natural gas systems?","The term 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems encompasses a wide range of equipment and operations involved in the extraction, processing, and distribution of natural gas and petroleum products. This includes onshore production, gathering and boosting, processing, transmission, distribution, and storage facilities. The equipment and operations covered under the definition of 'facility' include but are not limited to compressors, dehydrators, separators, storage tanks, combustion units, and various other components involved in the movement and treatment of natural gas and petroleum. The definition is comprehensive and encompasses all key stages of the natural gas and petroleum supply chain. EPA defines a 'facility' based on the equipment and components involved in the production, gathering, boosting, and processing of petroleum and natural gas. The emission factors provided in the tables specify the default whole gas emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and other related activities. These emission factors are used to estimate the emissions of methane and other hydrocarbons from the equipment. Additionally, the tables also provide default average component counts for major equipment, which can be used in conjunction with the emission factors to estimate the total emissions from the facilities. The emission factors and component counts are categorized based on the geographical location and the type of service (e.g., gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service) to provide specific values for different scenarios. The provided information does not contain the specific details related to the EPA's definition of a 'facility' for petroleum and natural gas systems. It appears to be a mix of mathematical expressions, conversion factors, and emissions calculations. It is recommended to refer to the official EPA documentation or guidelines for the precise definition of a 'facility' in the context of petroleum and natural gas systems.","al volumes of natural gas provided to end-users on their distribution systems. natural gas or other production well, and transferred to your facility. l gas from onshore production gas or oil wells and used to compress, dehydrate, sweeten, or transport the petroleum and/or natural gas to a natural gas processing facility, a natural gas transmission a natural gas processing facility, another gathering and boosting system, a natural gas transmission pipeline, or a distribution pipeline, or any person responsible for custody of the petroleum or nat stabilization, separation or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas (including condensate).

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) had a significant impact on emissions in various ways. It allowed owners or operators to estimate emissions occurring within a specific time frame and provided a framework for scoping speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations for certain processes. The method also enabled the estimation of subsequent year emissions using scoping speciations and facilitated the estimation of emissions of cover gases and carrier gases by monitoring changes in container weights and inventories.

Furthermore, BAMM affects emissions by providing emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and other facilities. These emission factors are used to estimate emissions from various equipment components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic devices, pumps, flanges, and other components. Moreover, BAMM affected emissions by providing a means to calculate and monitor the annual total volumetric GHG emissions at standard conditions from natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting, considering factors such as the total number of natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, population emissions factors, the concentration of GHG in produced natural gas, and the average estimated number of hours the pumps were operational.","ent year emissions., (1) Best available monitoring methods.

34,"How do I determine ""actual"" temperature and pressure in emission calculations?","To determine the 'actual' temperature and pressure in emission calculations, you would need to use the default whole gas emission factors provided in Table W-1A to Subpart W of Part 98. These emission factors are specified in standard cubic feet per hour per component and are categorized based on different equipment components and gas services. Additionally, you may also need to refer to other relevant tables such as Table W-1E for whole gas leaker emission factors and Table W-7 for methane emission factors for natural gas distribution. By using these emission factors along with the component counts from Table W-1B, W-1C, and W-1D, you can estimate the emissions based on the specific equipment and service type. Furthermore, to calculate the actual volumetric CO2 emissions at standard conditions in cubic feet per year, you would need to consider various factors such as the annual total volumetric GHG emissions at standard conditions, the total number of natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, the population emissions factors for natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, the concentration of GHG (CH4 or CO2) in produced natural gas, and the average estimated number of hours the pumps were operational. Additionally, the molar volume conversion factor at standard conditions and the stoichiometric ratio of CO2 and CaO for calcium carbonate may also need to be taken into account.","tion:, (1) Analysis of samples, determination of emissions, and raw data., (2) All information and data used to derive the emissions factor., (3) The production rate(s) during ific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5)., (d) de the analysis of samples, determination of emissions, and raw data.

39,How does this final rule relate to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program?,"The final rule primarily focuses on reporting requirements, emissions calculations, and quality assurance measures for various sources in the oil and natural gas industry. It outlines specific methods, standards, and procedures for reporting greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, processing, and distribution of natural gas and petroleum products.

54,How should the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks be determined to compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1)?,"The daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks can be determined by calculating the total annual oil/condensate throughput that is sent to all atmospheric tanks in the basin, in barrels. If the average daily natural gas throughput is greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, the reporting of this data element for onshore production can be delayed. Additionally, the volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production after completions of each newly drilled well can also be considered for determining the daily oil throughput. To determine the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks and compare it with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233(j)(1), you would need to calculate the total oil throughput for the day by summing the oil throughput from each storage tank using the formula: Total Oil Throughput = (Oil throughput from Storage Tank 1) + (Oil throughput from Storage Tank 2) + ... + (Oil throughput from Storage Tank n). Once you have the total oil throughput for the day, you can compare it with the threshold of 10 barrels a day as specified in 98.233(j)(1) to determine compliance. The steps to follow are: 1) Calculate the total oil throughput for the storage tanks over a year. 2) Divide the annual total oil throughput by 365 to obtain the daily oil throughput. 3) Compare the daily oil throughput with the threshold of 10 barrels a day as specified in 98.233(j)(1).","equal to 10 barrels per day that flow directly to atmospheric storage tanks in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting (if applicable ds throughput greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day that flow directly to atmospheric storage tanks in onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting., (i) Flow to storage t (A) The total annual oil/condensate throughput that is sent to all atmospheric tanks in the basin, in barrels.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA requires that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately capture and analyze the emissions data specific to each geologic province. This approach allows for a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions associated with petroleum and natural gas production in different geological regions. By reporting emissions data by basin, the EPA can better assess the environmental implications and develop targeted regulatory measures to mitigate the impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production on a regional basis. Additionally, reporting by basin helps capture the variability in emission factors and population emission factors across different geographical areas, leading to more accurate estimation of emissions. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the tracking and monitoring of CO2e emissions, calibration errors, reference values, and destruction efficiency associated with the annual CO2 mass emissions for specific fuel types in metric tons, enabling more effective environmental management and policy implementation.","ore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting.

63,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","Facilities without a GOR value for a well have several options to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring. They can conduct a well test to measure the volume of gas produced along with the volume of oil using a separator. Alternatively, they can estimate the GOR based on historical data from similar wells in the region or by using empirical correlations based on reservoir and fluid properties.

65,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my oil well operations to decide whether I need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, you can calculate the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure produced from a volume of oil using the formula GOR = Gas Production Rate / Oil Production Rate. This will give you the ratio of the volume of gas produced to the volume of oil produced. If the GOR is 300 scf/STB or greater for completions with hydraulic fracturing, it must be reported. The GOR can be determined by measuring the gas flowback rate during well completions and workovers and comparing it to the 30-day gas production rate. If GOR from each well is not available, the GOR from a cluster of wells can be used to calculate the average GOR of all wells. Additionally, the average API gravity of all wells and the average flow rate for well(s) tested in barrels of oil per day must be reported. You can also use the information provided in the tables W-1A, W-1B, W-1C, W-1D, W-1E, W-2, W-3A, W-3B, W-4A, W-4B, W-5A, W-5B, W-6A, W-6B, and W-7 of Subpart W of Part 98, which contain default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, storage, LNG operations, and distribution. By using the emission factors and component counts relevant to your specific operations, you can calculate the GOR and determine whether you need to report emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing. It's important to consult the relevant environmental regulatory authorities to determine the reporting obligations based on the GOR and other operational factors.","ies in the effluent of a stationary source., Gas to oil ratio (GOR) means the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when 8.236(cc) the gas to oil ratio for the well and the well ID number for the well., (B) Volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production after completions of each newly drilled well 98.233 to calculate the average gas production rate for an oil well, then you must report the information specified in paragraphs (g)(5)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section., (A) Gas to oil ratio completions with hydraulic fracturing that have a GOR of 300 scf/STB or greater (oil here refers to hydrocarbon liquids produced of all API gravities)., (7) Gas well venting during well workov for the well in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil (“GOR<E T=""52"">p” in Equation W–12C of § 98.233).

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"To determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines, there are several approaches you can take. Firstly, you can use the GOR from each well in the production gas/oil ratio and API gravity. If GOR from each well is not available, you can use the GOR from a cluster of wells. Additionally, you can use the default whole gas emission factors provided in Table W-1A to Subpart W of Part 98 to calculate the GOR by comparing the emission factors for gas service components with the emission factors for heavy crude service components. Furthermore, you would need to know the volume of gas and oil being produced or transported through the gathering pipelines in order to calculate the GOR by dividing the volume of gas by the volume of oil. Gathering pipelines with a GOR less than 300 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel (scf/STB) are not included in this industry segment. Therefore, the GOR for gathering pipelines can be determined based on the GOR from individual wells or a cluster of wells, considering the specific requirements for GOR in the given context.","ies in the effluent of a stationary source., Gas to oil ratio (GOR) means the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when 8.236(cc) the gas to oil ratio for the well and the well ID number for the well., (B) Volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production after completions of each newly drilled well le fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing 98.233 to calculate the average gas production rate for an oil well, then you must report the information specified in paragraphs (g)(5)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section., (A) Gas to oil ratio 1) Determine the GOR of the hydrocarbon production from each well whose associated natural gas is vented or flared.

71,"What is the definition of  ""fractionate"" and ""fractionation"" in 98.230(a)(3)?","In 98.230(a)(3), the term 'fractionate' refers to the process of separating a mixture of natural gas liquids (NGLs) into its individual constituents or components. This process is typically carried out by natural gas liquids fractionators, which are installations that fractionate NGLs into their constituent mixtures or blends. The fractionator follows specific procedures outlined in the regulations, including the use of equations for estimating CO2 emissions, reporting quantities of constituents separately, and complying with calculation methodologies for emissions estimation. Additionally, the fractionator may need to report information related to the volume of oil, mass of biomass combusted, and other operational parameters as specified in the subpart. The definition and procedures are essential for ensuring accurate reporting and monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions from fractionation processes. The provided tables contain default emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, transmission, storage, LNG facilities, and natural gas distribution, but do not explicitly provide the definition of 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in 98.230(a)(3).

If the annual average throughput of natural gas is 25 MMscf per day or greater, then the facility meets the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing. Additionally, the default emission factors provided in Table W-2 to Subpart W of Part 98 can be used to estimate the emissions from various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and meters by multiplying the emission factor with the number of components of each type in the plant. It's important to ensure that the units are consistent when performing these calculations. Furthermore, the reporting threshold can also be calculated using the formula: Reporting Threshold = 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year, based on the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) requirements for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids.","plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater., (4) Onshore natural gas transmission compression.

Combustion emissions from the sulfur recovery plant (e.g., from fuel combustion in the Claus burner or the tail gas treatment incinerator) must be reported ","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question.,1,"The answer does not accurately address the question.

97,Does Subpart W require reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility or does reporting start only when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage?,"The reporting of emissions under Subpart W begins when natural gas is transferred from its original location for the primary purpose of load balancing or storage. This includes emissions from underground natural gas storage processes and operations, as well as all the wellheads connected to the compression units located at the facility. Additionally, Subpart W of Part 98 provides default emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, transmission, storage, and distribution. However, the specific reporting requirements for emissions during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility are not explicitly mentioned in the provided tables. It is recommended to refer to the specific regulatory requirements and consult with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for detailed guidance on reporting emissions during the salt dome mining process for underground natural gas storage facilities. Furthermore, the formula analysis indicates that the reporting of emissions under Subpart W is required during the salt dome mining process to create an underground natural gas storage facility, including reporting of emissions from the mining process itself, not just when natural gas is introduced for load balancing or storage. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific regulatory requirements and consult with the EPA to ensure accurate reporting of emissions during the salt dome mining process for underground natural gas storage facilities.","natural gas or other production well, and transferred to your facility. ared) emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon produced liquids from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural ome caverns that store natural gas that has been transferred from its original location for the primary purpose of load balancing (the process of equalizing the receipt and delivery of natural gas); n nated gas production using uncontrolled GHG emissions. atural gas underground storage processes and operations (including compression, dehydration and flow measurement, and excluding transmission pipelines); and all the wellheads connected to the compress eable underground natural formation containing significant quantities of hydrocarbon liquids and/or gases., Residue Gas and Residue Gas Compression mean, respectively, production ion units located at the facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs., (6) Liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage.

Onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natu ","What constitutes a facility, how to determine the reporting threshold, and reporting of emissions from collocated and dual purpose equipment is as follows: 1) As a first step the reporter must determine the emissions from all equipment listed in 98.232(c) for onshore petroleum and production.  Per section 98.231(a) only sources listed in 98.232(c) need to be considered for threshold determination for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. 98.238 defines “facility” for the purposes of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems.  Per the requirements of 98.3 each “facility” must submit a GHG report for all source categories at that “facility”.  2) Note that while identifying onshore production emissions sources reporters have to determine whether the source is “on the well pad or associated with a well pad”.  The location of production wells within other facilities is inconsequential to this determination.  Sources on a well pad or associated with a well pad across the entire reporting basin have to be taken into consideration.  If your emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production are equal to or greater than 25,000mtCO2e, then onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities report as a separate facility and include all emissions sources listed in 98.232(c).  3) Except for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution, which have unique facility definitions, all other segments subject to subpart W are considered in the threshold determination for a single facility.  You would also include emissions from other source categories at your facility (e.g., stationary combustion).  If there are emissions sources that are dual purpose then the rule requires this piece of equipment to be reported under the majority use industry segment based on guidance provided in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (pp. 1606-1608).  4) For collocated industry segments, which cannot occur in the case of onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution due to the requirements in 98.231(a), EPA has provided guidance on emissions reporting in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14.  Based on the information provided, the facility cannot be reported as onshore production and natural gas processing combined (see point 1 above).  For all the other segments, the report should use guidance in points 2-3 above to determine the segment under which the facility should be categorized.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the reporting requirements for a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recovery and storage.

103,"How are we to treat GHG reporting applicability offshore LNG where the offshore terminal is basically buoy out in the ocean where a ship connects, regasifies the LNG onboard and injects natural gas under pressure into the pipeline?","The offshore LNG terminal, which regasifies LNG onboard and injects natural gas into the pipeline, falls under the category of LNG import and export equipment. This equipment receives imported LNG via ocean transport, stores LNG, and re-gasifies it for injection and recovery of natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs. Therefore, the GHG reporting applicability for this offshore LNG terminal would align with the requirements specified for LNG import and export equipment as outlined in § 98.232(e)(2). The provided tables contain default emission factors and population emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, transmission, storage, LNG import and export, and natural gas distribution. These factors can be used to estimate methane emissions from different equipment and components in the specified operations. However, specific guidance on how to treat GHG reporting applicability for offshore LNG terminals, where the terminal is essentially a buoy out in the ocean, is not directly provided in the given tables. Additional specific regulations or guidelines may need to be consulted for addressing the GHG reporting applicability for such offshore LNG terminals. Based on the information provided, the GHG reporting applicability for offshore LNG operations where the offshore terminal is a buoy out in the ocean involves the process of regasifying LNG onboard a ship and injecting natural gas under pressure into the pipeline. This process falls under the category of offshore LNG facilities, and the GHG emissions from such operations may need to be reported as per the relevant regulatory requirements for offshore facilities. It is important to consult the specific regulations and guidelines applicable to offshore LNG operations to determine the reporting requirements and applicability for GHG emissions in this scenario.","LNG, and delivers re-gasified natural gas to a natural gas transmission or distribution system.

108,"For a liquefied natural gas import facility, do boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported?","Yes, for a liquefied natural gas import facility, boil-off venting emissions from an LNG storage tank need to be reported. The emissions from the LNG storage tank fall under the category of LNG boil-off gas, which is defined as natural gas in the gaseous phase that vents from LNG storage tanks due to ambient heat leakage through the tank insulation and heat energy dissipated in the LNG. These emissions must be reported as part of the facility's environmental compliance and reporting obligations. The Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 98) mandates that the boil-off venting emissions are considered as part of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the LNG import facility and should be included in the annual report as per the regulatory requirements. Additionally, the default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components in LNG service are provided in Table W–5A to Subpart W of Part 98, and population emission factors for LNG storage components in LNG service are available in Table W–5B to Subpart W of Part 98, which can be used for estimating the emissions from the LNG storage components.","issions from blowdown vent stacks. , LNG boil-off gas means natural gas in the gaseous phase that vents from LNG storage tanks due to ambient heat leakage through the tank insulation and heat energy dissipated in the LNG by i >(2) Centrifugal compressor venting., (3) Transmission storage tanks., (4) Blowdown vent stacks., (5) Natural gas pneumatic device venting., (6) Flare stack emissions. , (2) Natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting., (3) Acid gas removal vents., (4) Dehydrator vents., (5) Blowdown vent stacks., (6) Storage tank vented emission lve leakage occurred for a transmission storage tank vent stack, as reported in paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section, and the vent stack vented directly to the atmosphere during the calendar year, th pressor venting at an onshore petroleum and natural gas production facility as specified in § 98.232(c)(19) or an onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facility as specified in § 98 Blowdown vent stack emissions mean natural gas and/or CO<E T=""52"">2 released due to maintenance and/or blowdown operations including compressor blowdown and emergency shut-down (ESD) system torage vessels located above ground, equipment for liquefying natural gas, compressors to capture and re-liquefy boil-off-gas, re-condensers, and vaporization units for re-gasification of the liquefie emissions from the following sources:, (1) Reciprocating compressor venting., (2) Centrifugal compressor venting., (3) Blowdown vent stacks., (4) Dehydrator vents. l gas gathering and boosting facility, report CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from the following source types:, (1) Natural gas pneumatic device venting. on pipelines vented within the facility boundary), compressors, scrubbers/strainers, pig launchers and receivers, emergency shutdowns (this category includes emergency shutdown blowdown emissions rega ared) emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon produced liquids from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural ion units located at the facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the underground reservoirs., (6) Liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage.

111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"If an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components, the owner or operator may discontinue complying with the equipment leak survey requirements provided that the station qualifies under the specified standards and the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator announcing the cessation of reporting. This provision allows for the discontinuation of annual leak surveys if no leaking components are found over consecutive years at the qualifying stations. However, the absence of leaking components during annual surveys at custody transfer city gate stations does not automatically warrant the removal of the requirement for annual leak surveys.

The provided tables on emission factors and population emission factors for different components and services are not directly related to the monitoring plan percentages mentioned.

We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question.

118,Do acid gas removal units which are used only to sweeten a liquid stream meet the definition of acid gas removal units?,"Based on the information provided, acid gas removal units are designed to separate hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide from sour natural gas using liquid or solid absorbents or membrane separators. Therefore, acid gas removal units used only to sweeten a liquid stream would still meet the definition of acid gas removal units, as they are intended to remove hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide contaminants from the sour natural gas, regardless of the specific application or purpose of the separated gas. Additionally, the formula analysis suggests that if the units used to sweeten a liquid stream are specifically designed to remove acid gases, then they would likely meet the definition of acid gas removal units. However, the table analysis indicates that specific information about acid gas removal units used only to sweeten a liquid stream is not available in the provided tables, making it difficult to determine conclusively.

121,For AGR vents is the use of a meter to measure flow rates required?,"Based on the integrated analysis, the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required for AGR vents. The text analysis indicates that the use of a meter, such as vane anemometers, flow meters, and other measurement devices, is necessary to determine volumetric flow rates at standard conditions for various venting sources, specifically for calculating emissions of CO2. Additionally, specific methods and standards, such as ASME MFC standards and ASTM practices, are outlined to ensure accurate quantification of emissions. The table analysis provides information on default emission factors for various components in different services, which can be used for estimation purposes without flow rate measurements. However, the formula analysis emphasizes the need to measure the volumetric flow rates of natural gas driven pneumatic pump venting, along with other factors such as population emissions factors and operational hours of the pumps. Therefore, the overall conclusion is that the use of a meter to measure flow rates is indeed required for AGR vents.","AGR vents (including processes such as amine, membrane, molecular sieve or other absorbents and adsorbents), calculate emissions for CO<E T=""52"">2 only (not CH<E T=""52"">4) vented directly to t g both those points where mine ventilation air is emitted and those where it is sold, used onsite, or otherwise destroyed (including by ventilation air methane (VAM) oxidizers)., (2) Each dega ach well and gob gas vent hole, from a centralized monitoring point, or from a combination of the two options.

It also specifies the reporting requirements for various sources such as reciprocating compressor venting, centrifugal compressor venting, blowdown vent stacks, flare stack emissions, and equipment leaks. Additionally, it outlines the measurement methods for gas or liquid flow rate, continuous gas composition analysis, and the use of blind flanges. The approval of the use of BAMM would depend on the specific requirements and guidelines provided by the EPA, as well as the regulations and guidelines outlined for the approval of monitoring methods in this context. The default whole gas leaker emission factors for various components in different services are available, along with population emission factors for different components and services. It is important to refer to the specific regulations and guidelines outlined by the EPA for the approval of monitoring methods in this context.","ead of a flare or vent, to measure the gas flowback.

The rule specifies that for dehydrators with an annual average daily natural gas throughput less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, the emissions are to be calculated using Equation W–5 of this section, and the dehydrator count and emissions factor. Therefore, the methods mentioned in the preamble do not align with the specific requirements outlined in the rule. Additionally, the emission factors for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd are not explicitly provided in the tables provided. However, the emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves are available in the tables. To calculate the emissions from dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd, the dehydrator count and emission factors for the specific components would need to be used as per the requirements in the rule.","average daily natural gas throughput greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, glycol dehydrators with an annual average daily natural gas throughput less than 0.4 million sta (e)(1) through (3)., (1) For each glycol dehydrator that has an annual average daily natural gas throughput greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day (as specified in § average of daily natural gas throughput that is less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day using Equation W–5 of this section:, (3) Calculation Method 3.
