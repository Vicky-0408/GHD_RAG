27,What percentage of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are reported under the GHGRP?,"The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) requires facilities in the oil and natural gas industry to report emissions of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O). These emissions are reported based on specific emission sources and industry segments, with a threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year.

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) allows operators to estimate emissions for parameters that cannot reasonably be measured according to monitoring and QA/QC requirements. Operators can request extensions for the use of BAMM beyond specific dates under unique and extreme circumstances, but not beyond certain dates. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator for the use of BAMM for specific parameters and source types, demonstrating that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate required monitoring equipment. However, the use of BAMM must be discontinued after certain dates, and all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements must be followed. Approval criteria must be met to use BAMM after specific dates, and the owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in relevant subparts. The use of best available monitoring methods will not be approved beyond certain dates, and the owner or operator must discontinue using them and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements. Therefore, the use of BAMM provides flexibility in estimating emissions when traditional monitoring methods are not feasible, but strict guidelines and approval criteria must be followed to ensure compliance with monitoring and QA/QC requirements.","The best available monitoring methods can be used for emissions measurement, well-related measurement data, and specified activity data if the required measurement data cannot reasonably be obtained according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

This includes emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and combustion-related emissions from stationary or portable equipment such as compressors, generators, dehydrators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, flares, separation and processing equipment, well drilling and completion equipment, workover equipment, leased, rented or contracted equipment, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations using CO2 or natural gas injection.","Based on the provided information, onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from equipment leaks, vented emissions, and combustion-related emissions from stationary or portable equipment.

110,Please explain how many leak detection surveys must be conducted a calendar year?  Must a facility indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year?,"At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year, and the selected surveys must be conducted during the same calendar year. If multiple complete leak detection surveys are conducted within a calendar year, the results from each complete survey must be used when calculating emissions using Equation W–30.

Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above-grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five-year period to cover all stations. If electing to use the multiple year option, the number of stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle. Facilities do not need to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year, but they must ensure that at least one survey is completed and that the results are used when calculating emissions.","At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year and the selected surveys must be conducted during the same calendar year.
