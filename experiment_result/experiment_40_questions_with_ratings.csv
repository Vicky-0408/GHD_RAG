85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank?

An alternative method to quantify the emissions may be used if it complies with the requirements specified in the regulations.","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",5,"The answer provides a complete and accurate explanation of the methods for monitoring tank emissions in § 98.233(k) and § 98.234(a)(1), as well as how intermittent emissions from the storage tank should be treated and the possibility of using an alternative method to quantify the emissions.

This would include all equipment associated with the wells owned or operated by the person or entity in the basin. Therefore, the facility would report CO2 emissions from the EOR operations and any associated equipment, as well as any other relevant emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering activities, in accordance with the reporting requirements specified in the subpart and corresponding subpart A.","Based on the provided information, a facility combining onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and storage would be considered one facility if the equipment is under common ownership or common control and located in a single hydrocarbon basin.

The methodology for adjusting emissions for the portion of gas flared during well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing is also provided in this section.","Under §98.232(e), emissions from flare stacks are not required to be reported as a separate emission source for onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities.  However, this does not exclude the reporting of flared emissions from the other emission sources listed in §98.232(e) if they are routed to a flare.  The flare source type in §98.233(n) covers only emissions that are not reported in association with any of the other source types in §98.233; see §98.233(n)(10).  For example, if transmission storage tank emissions are going to a flare, then the rule requires the adjustment of transmission storage tank emissions sent to flare per §98.233(k)(4).  The flared transmission storage tank emissions, however, have to be reported as transmission storage tank emissions under §98.236(c)(9).",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the correct guiding action for the calculation of flare stack emissions, as outlined in § 98.233 of the rule. It covers all the important aspects of the question and is perfectly relevant to the context.",5,"The answer provides the correct information as stated in the context. It outlines the methodology for calculating CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from partial combustion of hydrocarbon gas sent to a flare, as well as the emissions resulting from incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon gas in flares. It also specifies the requirements for calculating GHG emissions from flares, including the exclusion of gas used for flare pilots. Additionally, it details the calculation of annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions for each flare, as well as the reporting of N2O emissions from atmospheric tanks that controlled emissions with flares. The methodology for adjusting emissions for the portion of gas flared during well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing is also provided in this section, which is exactly what the question is asking for.",4,0.2782608696,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent as it provides a clear and complete explanation of the correct guiding action for the calculation of flare stack emissions, including the methodology for calculating CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, the requirements for calculating GHG emissions from flares, and the methodology for adjusting emissions for the portion of gas flared during well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing. The answer also addresses the specific question asked about which section of the rule is the correct guiding action.",842
136,Does a simple open pipe with no flare tip count as a flare under 98.233 (n ) in Subpart W?,"Based on the text analysis, a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not count as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W. This conclusion is supported by the absence of conflicting information from the table and formula analyses.","No, a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not count as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W.","40 CFR § 98.238 defines a flare as “…a combustion device, whether at ground level or elevated, that uses an open or closed flame to combust waste gases without energy recovery.”  An open pipe without combustion would not be considered a flare, but any hydrocarbon releases through it would be considered “vented emissions” under §98.238, which includes “process designed flow to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes.”",5,The answer directly addresses the question and provides a clear and accurate response based on the context and relevant information. It also provides additional supporting details that enhance the understanding of the topic.,5,"The answer directly states that a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not count as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W, which logically follows from the information provided in the context.",2,0.1414141414,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and direct response to the question. The sentences flow well together and the answer is supported by evidence from the text analysis, table, and formula analyses. However, there is some room for improvement in terms of making the sentences sound more natural as a whole.",229
137,"Under Subpart W, under both the onshore production and gas processing source categories, are we required to report emissions from all flares at the gas processing facility or on or associated with a well pad, including emergency flares?","Under Subpart W, facilities that are currently subject to this subpart W and acquire new sources from another facility that were not previously subject to this subpart W may use best engineering estimates for any data related to those newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart for the first 6 months of required data collection. Similarly, facilities that become newly subject to this subpart W may also use best engineering estimates for any data that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart for the first 6 months of required data collection.
