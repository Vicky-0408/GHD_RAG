1,Who is required to report under subpart W?,No answer found,No context found,"This rule making requires reporting from the following petroleum and natural gas industry segments: onshore petroleum and natural gas production, offshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas processing, natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage and LNG import and export.  Facilities that contain petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year are required to report annual GHG emissions to EPA.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance as it does not provide any information related to the question.,1,"The answer does not provide any information about who is required to report under subpart W. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.0,5,The answer straightforwardly says that it doesn't know and makes no attempt to answer the question.,1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the question asked.,15,,
2,What GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities are covered under the rule?,"The document mentioned that the rule covers GHG emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting, natural gas processing, and natural gas transmission compression facilities. It defines a facility as all equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad, including leased, rented, or contracted activities, under common ownership or control, and located in a single hydrocarbon basin. The rule also specifies reporting requirements for different types of facilities, such as the quantities and types of emissions to be reported, the calculation methods to be used, and the conditions for reporting specific equipment or activities. It outlines specific emission sources and components, such as natural gas dehydrators, compressors, generators, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares, and provides default emission factors for different equipment types. Additionally, it sets emission thresholds for reporting and specifies monitoring and QA/QC requirements for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The document also mentions the use of specific equations and default emission factors for calculating CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities. The provided tables contain default emission factors for different equipment types and material types, as well as average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment. These tables can be used to calculate GHG emissions at oil and natural gas system facilities as covered under the rule.","The rule covers GHG emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting, natural gas processing, and natural gas transmission compression facilities.

}","Subpart W of part 98 requires petroleum and natural gas facilities to report annual methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from equipment leaks and venting, and emissions of CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) from flaring, onshore production stationary and portable combustion emissions, and combustion emissions from stationary equipment involved in natural gas distribution. Facilities covered by this rule might also be required to report emissions under other subparts of the GHG Reporting Program, if applicable.  The GHG Reporting Program requires reporting of GHG emissions: CO2, CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated GHGs: hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases.  These gases are often expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e).",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate summary of the GHG emissions covered under the rule, including the types of facilities, equipment, and emission sources. It also mentions the reporting requirements, calculation methods, emission factors, and component counts provided in the document.

3,Will EPA provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule?,No answer found,No context found,"EPA has developed a voluntary screening tool for the petroleum and natural gas source category to assist reporters in their applicability determinations - the ""applicability tool"".  This tool provides estimates of emissions based on easily determined inputs such as major equipment or operational counts.  While the applicability tool is designed to help potential reporters comply with the rule, compliance with all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations remains the sole responsibility of each facility owner or operator subject to those laws and regulations. The applicability tool only serves as a guide to determine those facilities that are clearly well below the reporting threshold, those clearly above, and those close to the threshold who will need to collect further data to make a proper determination.",,,1,The answer is not possible to determine whether it is true or false without further information as there is no context provided to assess the applicability of EPA tool for oil and natural gas system facilities.,1,0.0,5,"The answer straightforwardly says that no answer was found, and makes no attempt to answer the question.",1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the question asked.,15,,
4,Do the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements?,"The facility definitions in the rule affect other EPA reporting requirements by specifying the criteria for reporting greenhouse gas emissions at the facility level, including specific thresholds for reporting, applicability requirements, and the need to retain certain information at the facility level. The rule also outlines the conditions under which a facility is required to report under the rule and provides guidance on changes that could cause a facility to meet the applicability requirements. Additionally, it describes the specific actions a facility should take to obtain and install equipment as soon as reasonably feasible, and the annual reporting requirements for facilities that become subject to the rule due to physical or operational changes. The provided tables contain data related to population emission factors, default average component counts, and leaker emission factors for various equipment and services in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering industry. These tables provide specific values and factors that can be used in calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions as per the EPA reporting requirements.","The facility definitions in the rule affect other EPA reporting requirements by specifying the criteria for reporting greenhouse gas emissions at the facility level, including specific thresholds for reporting, applicability requirements, and the need to retain certain information at the facility level.

}","Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year must report. The rule defines three different types of facilities. You must apply the 25,000 ton per year threshold separately to each facility to determine if that facility must report. • For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, a facility is defined generally as all emission source types (see the table below) on a well pad or associated with a well pad that are under common ownership or control in a single hydrocarbon basin, as defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. • For natural gas distribution industry segment, a facility generally is defined as the collection of all pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by a single local distribution company. • For all other industry segments, use the facility definition in the General Provisions to part 98. Under this definition, a facility is defined generally as all sources for which emission calculation methods are provided in 40 CFR part 98 (including those in the table below) and that are located on a contiguous property and under common ownership or common control. See 40 CFR part 98, subparts A and W for the precise definition of each of the three “facility” types.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive list of the facilities required to report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems), as well as the reporting requirements.

See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors. For the use of population factors, the relevant emission factor will be applied to all components.",5,"The answer provides a detailed and accurate explanation of how greenhouse gas emissions for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities are calculated.

}","Starting in 2013 and each year thereafter, reports must be submitted to EPA by March 31 of each year, unless the 31st is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, in which case the reports are due on the next business day.  Facilities subject to subpart W must begin monitoring GHG emissions on January 1, 2011 in accordance with the methods specified in subpart W. For 2012 only, the GHG report must be submitted to EPA by September 28, 2012. This reporting deadline applies to all subparts being reported by the facility. If your subpart W facility submitted a GHG annual report for reporting year 2010 under another subpart (e.g., subpart C for general stationary fuel combustion), then by April 2, 2012 you must notify EPA through e-GGRT that you are not required to submit the second annual report until September 28, 2012 (the notification deadline according to 4 CFR 98.3(b) is March 31, 2012, however, because this date falls on a Saturday in 2012, the notification is due on the next business day).",5,"The answer provides a complete and accurate response to the question, including the specific details of when reporting for subpart W begins and the allowance for best engineering estimates for newly acquired sources in the first 6 months of data collection.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by stating that reporting for subpart W begins as soon as a facility becomes subject to this subpart, and for the first 6 months of required data collection, facilities that are currently subject to subpart W and that acquire new sources from another facility that were not previously subject to this subpart may use best engineering estimates for any data related to those newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart.

It also specifies the method (EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A–7) for determining the number of sources of equipment type with screening values greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv. Additionally, the document provides tables with default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, default average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. The tables include information such as emission factors for different components under different survey methods, population emission factors for different equipment types in Eastern and Western U.S., and average component counts for different equipment types in Eastern and Western U.S. These tables can be used to derive emission estimates and screening values for subpart W compliance.","The document mentions that facilities subject to subpart W may use best engineering estimates for data related to newly acquired sources or newly subject facilities for the first 6 months of required data collection.

}","No. EPA’s intention in posting subpart W calculation utilities is to provide facilities with a simple tool for estimating emissions when determining applicability.  Additionally, the tools include a guidance and source tab to document how emission estimates were calculated.  The utilities are only a guide to help facilities determine their subpart W applicability.  If you suspect a facility may exceed the annual 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold, you should refer to the calculation methodologies in 98.233 to determine emissions.",,,5,"The answer provides relevant information from the document that explains how to derive emission estimates and screening values for subpart W compliance, which is related to the question asked.",1,0.1725490196,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides relevant information about the use of best engineering estimates and EPA Method 21 for determining the number of sources with screening values greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv. It also mentions the availability of tables with default emission factors and component counts that can be used for subpart W compliance.

13,The applicability tool for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas has an operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons. How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The document mentioned detailed information about the calculation methods and equations for estimating and reporting annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing. It also provided tables with default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. However, the specific operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons was not explicitly provided. The document outlines procedures and equations for calculating the emissions, which can be used to analyze the correlation with the barrels of crude oil produced. The tables include emission factors for various components and equipment, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic devices, which can be used in the calculation of emissions. The correlation between the volume of oil produced and associated gas venting can be analyzed using the emission factors and component counts provided in the tables, along with the relevant equations and procedures outlined in the document.","The document provides detailed information about the calculation methods and equations for estimating and reporting annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing.

}","You are correct that on April 25, 2011, EPA finalized a rule extending the deadline for submission of a request to use BAMM until July 31, 2011 (76 FR 22825).  On June 27, 2011, a proposed rule was published in the Federal Register that would allow automatic use of BAMM for the entire 2011 reporting year for emissions sources covered under subpart W (Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems) without seeking approval from EPA (76 FR 37300).  The public comment period for the proposed rule will be open through July 27, 2011.  Given the timing necessary to consider public comment and finalize the rule, EPA will not be able to promulgate the final rule by July 31, 2011.  Please note that 40 CFR 98.234(f)(1) indicates that ""If the reporter anticipates the potential need for best available monitoring for sources for which they need to petition EPA and the situation is unresolved at the time of the deadline, reporters should submit written notice of this potential situation to EPA by the specified deadline for requests to be considered.""  EPA agrees that as of July 31, 2011, the circumstances surrounding the applicability of the deadline will be ""unresolved"" and that submitting a notification of intent would satisfy the rule requirements.",5,"The answer accurately states that the proposed amendments to subpart W, issued on June 20, 2011, will not be finalized before the existing deadline in the rule of July 31, 2011. This fully addresses the main aspect of the question and provides a clear and complete answer.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context. It explicitly states that the proposed amendments will not be finalized before the existing deadline in the rule of July 31, 2011, therefore the proposed amendments to subpart W issued on June 20, 2011 that delay the due date for BAMM extension requests to December 31, 2011 will not be finalized before the existing deadline.",5,0.2572614108,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise response to the question, citing the relevant information from the document and explaining the implications of the proposed amendments to subpart W.",387,,

Are all industry segments included in one annual GHG report?,"The text provides detailed information about the requirements and procedures for reporting under subpart W, which includes specific provisions for different types of facilities such as petroleum and natural gas systems, industrial wastewater treatment, underground coal mines, and others. It outlines the use of best engineering estimates for data collection for newly acquired sources and the application of default emission factors for certain facilities. The text also mentions the need to report under other applicable subparts of the regulations and the use of specific calculation methods and equations for reporting GHG emissions. However, it does not explicitly state whether all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report. The provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for various equipment in different regions, which can be used in the calculation of GHG emissions. These tables provide valuable data for understanding the emission factors associated with different components in the petroleum and natural gas industry. Overall, the text and tables offer insights into the reporting requirements and emission calculation methods for facilities under subpart W, but do not directly address the specific question about the inclusion of all industry segments in one annual GHG report.","The text provides detailed information about the requirements and procedures for reporting under subpart W, which includes specific provisions for different types of facilities such as petroleum and natural gas systems, industrial wastewater treatment, underground coal mines, and others.

The answer is well-structured and all sentences fit together naturally, making it easy to understand and follow.",1727,,
26,Does the current GHGRP data include all U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems?,"The document provides detailed information about onshore petroleum and natural gas systems, including gathering and boosting, natural gas processing, and production equipment. It outlines the equipment and activities that must be reported under the GHGRP, and specifies the emission factors and calculation methods to be used for reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. The document does not explicitly state whether the current GHGRP data includes all U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems, but it does provide the framework for reporting such emissions. Additionally, the document includes tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions of the U.S., which can be used to estimate emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems. The provided tables contain information on emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic pumps, and other components, which can be used in the calculation of emissions. Therefore, while the document does not directly confirm the inclusion of all U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems in the current GHGRP data, it does provide the necessary information and framework for reporting and estimating such emissions.","The document provides detailed information about onshore petroleum and natural gas systems, including gathering and boosting, natural gas processing, and production equipment. It outlines the equipment and activities that must be reported under the GHGRP, and specifies the emission factors and calculation methods to be used for reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. It also includes thresholds for reporting emissions from different industry segments and defines terms related to petroleum and natural gas production. The document does not explicitly state whether the current GHGRP data includes all U.S. emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems, but it does provide the framework for reporting such emissions.{

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The document mentioned the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for estimating emissions when it was not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate required monitoring equipment. Requests for extensions of the use of BAMM were permitted for unique and extreme circumstances, with the EPA not anticipating approving the use of BAMM to estimate emissions beyond December 31, 2011. The text also outlined special reporting provisions for BAMM in reporting years and the need to discontinue using BAMM after a certain date. It provided detailed information on the usage, extension, and approval criteria for Best Available Monitoring Methods in estimating emissions. Additionally, the document mentioned specific monitoring methods such as continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and the calculation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The provided equations and tables offer detailed information on emission factors, conversion factors, and component counts for various equipment and services, which are essential for estimating emissions. These factors and counts are crucial for understanding the impact of BAMM on emissions and for making accurate estimations.","The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) was allowed for specific time periods, such as from January 1 to March 31 of certain years, for estimating emissions when it was not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate required monitoring equipment. Requests for extensions of the use of BAMM were permitted for unique and extreme circumstances. However, EPA did not anticipate approving the use of BAMM to estimate emissions beyond December 31, 2011. The document also mentioned special reporting provisions for BAMM in reporting years, and the need to discontinue using BAMM and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements after a certain date. The text also outlined approval criteria and requests for extension of the use of BAMM, including demonstrating the infeasibility of acquiring, installing, and operating required monitoring equipment. The use of BAMM was also mentioned in relation to specific monitoring methods such as continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and the calculation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Overall, the document provided detailed information on the usage, extension, and approval criteria for Best Available Monitoring Methods in estimating emissions.{

}","The GHGRP covers the same sources of emissions in California as CARB, but there are differences in the reporting thresholds as well as how facilities are defined.  CARB has a different definition for onshore production facilities than the GHGRP.  The practical implication is that individual CARB facilities reporting under onshore production may be larger than comparable GHGRP facilities.  However, there will be more facilities in the GHGRP, and those facilities will cover the same emissions as the smaller number of CARB facilities.  It is not expected that the total emissions covered will be different between the GHGRP and CARB.",3,"The answer partially addresses the main aspects of the question by providing information on the GHG emissions reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems, including the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for offshore facilities, the types of facilities that must report GHG emissions, the calculation methods to be used, and the specific information to be reported for different equipment types and geographic locations.

However, it does provide information on the submission of verification data and complete annual GHG reports for those reporting years. Additionally, it includes tables with default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. These tables could be used to calculate emissions and verify the data submitted in the annual reports. It's important to note that the provided equations do not seem to be relevant to the question and may be unrelated to the environmental regulations and data submission.","Based on the provided information, if you resubmit an annual report for RY2011, 2012, or 2013, you must submit the verification data and information within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Administrator, as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(v), and (e)(2)(vii) of the section. Additionally, you must submit the complete annual GHG reports for reporting years 2011, 2012, and 2013 by March 31, 2015, containing the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (i) of the section.{

It also outlines the use of specific calculation methods and monitoring requirements. The document provides guidance on the use of default emission factors and the reporting of emissions from various equipment types. Based on this information, an offshore facility reported in the GOADS 2008 that did not exceed the combined emissions threshold for subparts C and W sources of more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e would not have to report GHG emissions for RY2011 if emissions exceed this threshold. This is because the document clearly states that facilities must report emissions only if certain emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, and it does not mention any additional reporting requirements for facilities that previously did not exceed this threshold.","The document specifies the reporting requirements for offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, including the calculation and reporting of annual emissions.

Additionally, there are tables that provide default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment.

}","Yes. The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",4,"The answer provides relevant information about the reporting requirements for GHG emissions from an offshore facility that emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources. The answer correctly states that the facility would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011 if the emissions from both sources are 25,000 metric tons of CO2e or more per year. The answer also mentions the equations and explanations provided in the text for calculating emissions, as well as the tables that provide default emission factors and component counts for different sources at the facility. However, the answer does not explicitly mention the relevance of the information to the question, which is why it receives a score of 4 instead of 5.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. It is stated that an offshore facility that emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources based on GOADS calculation methodology and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011 if they emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2e or more per year. The emissions from both sources are subject to reporting if they emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2e or more per year, which is the case for this facility.",4,0.3267973856,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear and concise response to the question. It accurately states that the offshore facility emitting 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011. The answer also provides additional information on the equations and tables that can be used to calculate emissions from different sources at the offshore facility.",900,,
47,"Can we use 2011 BOEMRE data, rather than the previously available data from 2008, for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility?","The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emission from the data. The equations provided in the text describe the variables and their units for calculating emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The equations include the calculation of fuel, high heat value of the fuel (HHV), fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor (EF), annual natural gas usage, and annual CO2 mass emissions from natural gas combustion. Additionally, the document provides tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment counts for major onshore natural gas production and gathering equipment. These tables can be used to calculate the emissions based on the specific components and equipment present at the facility. Therefore, the 2011 BOEMRE data can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility, utilizing the provided equations and tables for accurate calculations.","Based on the provided information, the 2011 BOEMRE data can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility. The data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304, referenced in the provided text, should be utilized for calculating and reporting annual emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.{

Additionally, it includes tables with default emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, as well as average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment. These tables provide valuable information for calculating and reporting emissions data. Therefore, based on the information provided, offshore oil and gas production facilities that are farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, are indeed required to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C.","Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions as per the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304.

It correctly states that offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions as per the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE in compliance with 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. It also mentions the specific calculation methods and monitoring requirements for different types of facilities, as well as the default emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities. The answer concludes that offshore oil and gas production facilities that are farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, are indeed required to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C. Overall, the answer is highly relevant and provides a comprehensive explanation of the topic.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.

The answer correctly interprets this information and concludes that offshore facilities are required to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C. The additional information provided in the answer about specific calculation methods and monitoring requirements for different types of facilities, as well as tables with default emission factors, further supports the conclusion that offshore oil and gas production facilities that are farther out in the ocean than the limit of state waters, as defined by the Submerged Lands Act, are indeed required to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C.",4,0.1030927835,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question and does not convey any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is well-structured and coherent. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the requirements for reporting emissions data for offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, including the specific regulations and calculation methods involved. The answer also acknowledges the existence of tables with default emission factors for onshore facilities and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, which further support the conclusion that offshore facilities are required to report emissions data to EPA for Subpart C.

49,By when do onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report?,"Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report the information specified in paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, for each major equipment type, production type, and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C to this subpart for which equipment leak emissions are calculated using the methodology in § 98.233(r). The facilities must also use appropriate default whole gas leaker emission factors for components in gas service, light crude service, and heavy crude service listed in Table W–1E to this subpart. Additionally, facilities must report emissions from fuel combusted in stationary or portable equipment as specified in § 98.236(z) and not according to the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part. The document also mentions that facilities must report emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment only if emission sources specified in § 98.232(c) emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Offshore production facilities under BOEMRE jurisdiction shall report the same annual emissions as calculated and reported by BOEMRE in data collection and emissions estimation study published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 (GOADS). Offshore production facilities that are not under BOEMRE jurisdiction must use the most recent monitoring methods and calculation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 250.304 to calculate and report annual emissions (GOADS). The document also provides tables with default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. These tables provide specific emission factors and component counts for different regions and equipment types, which are essential for calculating and reporting emissions as required by CFR 98 Subpart W.","Onshore and offshore production facilities subject to CFR 98 Subpart W need to report the information specified in paragraphs (r)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, for each major equipment type, production type, and geographic location combination in Tables W–1B and W–1C to this subpart for which equipment leak emissions are calculated using the methodology in § 98.233(r). The facilities must also use appropriate default whole gas leaker emission factors for components in gas service, light crude service, and heavy crude service listed in Table W–1E to this subpart. Additionally, facilities must report emissions from fuel combusted in stationary or portable equipment as specified in § 98.236(z) and not according to the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part.

Offshore production facilities subject to GOADS are required to use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE to report annual emissions in 2012.

The answer also mentions the equations and explanations for various emission factors and calculation methods, as well as the tables with default average component counts and population emission factors for different equipment and services. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how the equations and tables are used to calculate emissions.",912,,
52,Are the emissions factors listed in Table W-1A for both leaking components and non-leaking components? How do you calculate emissions from leaking components if onshore petroleum and natural gas source are not required to monitor components?,"The emissions factors listed in Table W-1A are indeed used for both leaking and non-leaking components. However, emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources are not required to be monitored. In such cases, the appropriate default whole gas leaker factors for components in gas service listed in Table W–1E must be used for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. Table W-1A provides emission factors for various components in different services and regions for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering/boosting facilities. On the other hand, Table W-1E provides leaker emission factors for various components in gas service for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering/boosting facilities, based on different survey methods. Therefore, when emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources are not required to be monitored, the appropriate default whole gas leaker factors from Table W-1E should be used for calculation.","The emissions factors listed in Table W-1A are used for both leaking and non-leaking components.

}","Equipment leak emissions in onshore production are to be estimated using methods provided in 98.233(r)(2).  Hence, no leak detection of emissions is required for onshore production.  Table W-1A provides population emission factors, which represent the emissions on an average from the entire population of components – both leaking and non-leaking; please see section 6(d) of the Technical Support Document (http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_TSD.pdf) for further details on the concept of population emission factors.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how to calculate emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources when monitoring is not required.

54,How should the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks be determined to compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1)?,"The document provides detailed instructions and calculation methods for determining the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks and comparing it with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1). It specifies Calculation Methods 1, 2, and 3 for calculating CH4 and CO2 emissions based on the daily throughput of oil. Additionally, it outlines the requirement to report the total annual oil volume from gas-liquid separators and direct from wells or non-separator equipment that is sent to applicable onshore production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks in barrels. The document also discusses the need to analyze a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment oil for oil composition and Reid vapor pressure and to report the total annual oil/condensate throughput that is sent to all atmospheric tanks in the basin, in barrels. Furthermore, it mentions specific software programs for calculating CH4 and CO2 emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks based on the operating conditions in the last gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks. The provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, which can be used in the calculation methods specified in the document.","To determine the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks and compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1), the document specifies Calculation Methods 1, 2, and 3 for calculating CH4 and CO2 emissions based on the daily throughput of oil.

It provides definitions of basin, sub-basin, and facility in this context, emphasizing the need to report emissions separately for each emission source type, component type, service type, and geographic location. The document also outlines specific equations and calculation methods for determining emissions, as well as requirements for quality assurance of GHG emissions data. Additionally, it includes tables with default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. These tables provide emission factors for different components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S., which can be used in the calculation of emissions as per the provided equations.","Geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to ensure comprehensive reporting of emissions from all related equipment within a specific geographic area. The definition of a facility as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or control, including leased, rented, or contracted activities, and located in a single hydrocarbon basin allows for the aggregation of all equipment associated with wells in a basin as one facility. This approach helps in accurately monitoring and managing emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production, thereby supporting environmental regulations and sustainability efforts.","The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin because they define a facility as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or control, including leased, rented, or contracted activities, and located in a single hydrocarbon basin.

                                ""Emission factor (scf/hour/component) If","When the GHGRP requirements for onshore petroleum and natural gas production were proposed, EPA’s goal was to provide a facility definition that all producers could directly apply, and that would be both practical and cost-effective.  EPA sought public comment on a range of possible options for defining the facility that would report with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, ranging from defining the facility at the individual well pad, to defining the facility at the field-level, to defining the facility at the basin-level.  Taking into account public comment, EPA finalized the definition of facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas production using a basin-level approach because the operational boundaries and basin demarcations are clearly defined and are widely known, and the approach covered most emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. It correctly states that this approach helps in accurately monitoring and managing emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production, thereby supporting environmental regulations and sustainability efforts. The answer also correctly defines a facility as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or control, including leased, rented, or contracted activities, and located in a single hydrocarbon basin. Overall, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",4,0.347826087,1,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation for why the EPA required facilities to report by basin, without any indication of uncertainty or lack of knowledge.",5,"The answer is well-written and coherent. It provides a clear explanation of why the EPA required facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production to report by basin. The answer also explains how the definition of a facility as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or control, including leased, rented, or contracted activities, and located in a single hydrocarbon basin allows for the aggregation of all equipment associated with wells in a basin as one facility, ensuring comprehensive reporting of emissions from all related equipment within a specific geographic area. The answer is easy to follow and the sentences fit together naturally as a whole.",798,,
63,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","Facilities can determine the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) for associated gas venting and flaring by using the gas to oil ratio of the hydrocarbon production from oil well(s) tested, or by determining the production rate from gas well(s) tested. If GOR from each well is not available, they can use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category. Additionally, they can calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading using one of the calculation methods described in the section. The document also provides default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and total hydrocarbon emission factors for various processes, which can be used to calculate emissions and determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring.","Facilities can determine the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) for associated gas venting and flaring by using the gas to oil ratio of the hydrocarbon production from oil well(s) tested, or by determining the production rate from gas well(s) tested.

Additionally, it mentions the calculation methods described in the section for calculating annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading. The answer also highlights the availability of default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, and total hydrocarbon emission factors for various processes, which can be used to calculate emissions and determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring.

However, it does contain tables with information on default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The tables provide data on emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps, as well as component counts for different equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions. While the input does not explicitly mention the optional delayed reporting requirements for wildcat wells and delineation wells, it does provide valuable information related to emissions and equipment in the petroleum and natural gas production industry.","The optional delayed reporting requirements for wildcat wells and delineation wells include the gas to oil ratio, the volume of oil produced during the first 30 days of production, the flowback rate, the average annual production rate, the average daily gas production rate, and the average flow rate. If the reporting is delayed, the well ID number for the well must be reported by the specified date. The document also provides definitions for wildcat well, delineation well, horizontal well, vertical well, well completion, and well workover.{

It outlines the definition of GOR, the measurement units, and the circumstances under which reporting of GOR data can be delayed. The document also specifies the calculation methods for average gas production rate, annual mass of CO2 produced, and the estimation of CO2 emissions downstream of the storage tank. It emphasizes the importance of accurately measuring and reporting GOR for oil wells, especially in the context of well venting during completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, the document provides guidance on estimating CO2 emissions from various equipment and processes in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as the estimation of CO2 sequestered in underground subsurface formations. The document also includes tables with default emission factors and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, which can be used in the calculation of emissions. The equations and explanations provided in the document describe the calculation methods for fuel, high heat value (HHV), CO2 emission factor (EF), and annual natural gas usage, which are essential for determining emissions. Overall, the document contains comprehensive information and tools necessary for determining the GOR and reporting emissions from completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing.","The document provides detailed information on how to determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for oil well operations, including the calculation methods and reporting requirements.

}","The gathering and boosting system owner or operator can use a direct measurement of GOR through either onsite measurement or by sending samples out for laboratory analysis. The timing and duration of the sampling/measurement program should follow existing regulatory requirements, which include standard methods published by a consensus-based standards organization or industry standard practices. See 40 CFR 98.234(b). The EPA realizes that owners or operators may calculate GOR for other reasons such as documenting fluid quality for financial transactions, equipment optimization or other state/federal reporting requirements. These values can be used where appropriate.A825. 40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W does not prescribe a specific approach to calculate GOR. Gathering and boosting system operators may use the best approach for their facility, including direct measurement, calculation from other measured data, and standard estimation measures. We note that within the EPA’s 2016 updates to New Source Performance Standards for the oil and natural gas sector, GOR is defined as the ratio of the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure that is produced from a volume of oil when depressurized to a standard temperature and pressure.

It also mentions the exemption criteria for reporting emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment based on the emission threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year. However, it does not explicitly state whether the exemption applies only to the pipeline itself or to all equipment along the pipeline. The document also includes various equations and tables related to emission factors, component counts, and population emission factors for different equipment and services in the onshore petroleum and natural gas industry. These equations and tables can be used to calculate emissions and understand the environmental impact of the equipment and services involved in the industry.","The text provides detailed information about the Gas to Oil Ratio (GOR) and its calculation methodology for the hydrocarbon production from oil wells.

}",It is EPA’s intention for the purpose of Subpart W to follow general industry parlance whereby “fractionate” and “fractionation” refers to the separation of NGLs into individual chemical species or commercial products.,4,"The answer provides a clear and accurate definition of 'fractionate' and 'fractionation' in the context of separating natural gas liquids (NGLs) into individual component products such as ethane, propane, butanes, and pentane-plus. The answer also mentions the measurement requirements for NGL fractionators and specifies the procedures they need to follow.

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported from forced extraction of natural gas liquids, sulfur and carbon dioxide removal, fractionation of NGLs, or the capture of CO2 separated from natural gas streams. Additionally, the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for all emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities should be reported. The document also provides tables with population emission factors for different components and services in both Eastern and Western U.S., as well as default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression. These tables can be used to calculate and report vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing.","Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported from the following sources: forced extraction of natural gas liquids, sulfur and carbon dioxide removal, fractionation of NGLs, or the capture of CO2 separated from natural gas streams.

It defines fractionators as installations that fractionate natural gas liquids into their constituent liquid products, such as ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane, or pentanes plus. Additionally, the document includes details on the determination of quantity for NGL fractionators and the calculation methodology for estimating CO2 emissions from the complete combustion or oxidation of the NGL products supplied. It also contains tables with emission factors for different components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, which can be used for further analysis and calculations.","Facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W.

However, it does not directly provide a specific calculation for the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. The calculation for the reporting threshold may involve using the annual volumes in Mscf of natural gas received for processing and comparing it with regulatory thresholds or emission factors. Further information or specific regulatory guidelines may be required to accurately calculate the reporting threshold.","The reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater should be calculated based on the annual volumes in Mscf of natural gas received for processing.{

While the context provides information on default emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas processing plants, it does not directly provide a specific calculation for the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater. The answer correctly states that the calculation for the reporting threshold may involve using the annual volumes in Mscf of natural gas received for processing and comparing it with regulatory thresholds or emission factors, but also notes that further information or specific regulatory guidelines may be required to accurately calculate the reporting threshold.",2,0.4046242775,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides information on default emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas processing plants. However, it does not directly provide a specific calculation for the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.

}","However, please note that if, in year 2, your throughput capacity is less than 25 MMscf per day, you are not required to calculate and report GHG emissions from gas processing in year 2.  You would still be required to report other covered emissions at your facility.  This is because gas processing would not be an applicable segment for year 2.  Nevertheless, your facility would still be required to report in year 2, even if facility-wide emissions are less than 25,000mt CO2e, and would continue to report until you meet the criteria in 98.2(i) for ceasing to report.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.  This throughput is re-evaluated annually.  Once you are subject to the rule (e.g., your facility contains a source category listed in Table A-4), your facility must continue complying with all the requirements of this part, even if the facility does not meet the applicability requirements in a future year (i.e., 25,000 mtCO2e for petroleum and natural gas systems). The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",4,"The answer correctly identifies the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and mentions that the frequency of re-evaluation for falling below this threshold is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, the answer does not provide a specific answer to the second part of the question regarding how often a facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold, which slightly reduces its relevance.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3), which is that onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater fall under this category. The answer also correctly states that the frequency of re-evaluation for falling below this threshold is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.",4,0.2591362126,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer provides a clear and coherent explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3).

According to the information provided, both the emission threshold and the throughput are considered for determining the applicability of reporting GHG emissions under subpart W.

}","Since the throughput of the facility was identified in the question as 30 MMscf per day throughput capacity, this exceeds the exclusion identified in the §98.230(a)(3) for processing facilities that do not fractionate.  Therefore, this facility falls under the onshore natural gas processing industry segment definition as defined in §98.230(a)(3) and these emissions would be included in the applicability determination for your facility.  (If the throughput were less than 25 MMscf this source would not have been considered in the applicability determination for the facility.)  However, based on the information provided, since the processing facility has less than 25,000 metric tons CO2e in combined emissions from stationary combustion, flaring, vented, and fugitive sources, the facility does not need to report under subpart W.  Both the 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold (from §98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day annual average throughput (from §98.230(a)(3)) are considered when determining subpart W applicability for a natural gas processing facility.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning both the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year emission threshold defined in § 98.2(a)(2) and the 25 MMscf per day throughput for onshore natural gas processing facilities.

81,May engineering calculations be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product?,"The document provides detailed instructions and equations for calculating emissions from flare gas. It specifies the requirement to use gas compositions for each stream of hydrocarbons going to the flare, either from continuous gas composition analyzers or through engineering calculation based on process knowledge and best available data. Additionally, the document includes tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions of the U.S., which can be used in the engineering calculations for flare gas composition. The tables provide emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components, which can be utilized in the engineering calculations for flare gas composition. The document also includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, which can be used in the engineering calculations. Overall, the document outlines the methods and data sources that can be used for engineering calculations of flare gas composition, as required in equations W-19 through W-21.","The document provides detailed instructions and equations for calculating emissions from flare gas, including the use of continuous gas composition analyzers and engineering calculations.

The emission factors for leaker components and total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing are also provided. These emission factors can be used in conjunction with the equipment counts to estimate emissions from the dehydrators and other components in the onshore natural gas processing source category.","The onshore natural gas processing source category includes dehydrators, as mentioned in the text.

}","98.232 (d) states that “for onshore natural gas processing, report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the following sources”.  For example, if the compressor stream is 100% propane then the emissions will not include CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions and therefore will not have to be reported under subpart W.  However, if the facility exceeds the 25,000 mtCO2e threshold then the owner or operator must report combustion emissions for this compressor under subpart C.",3,"The answer partially addresses the main aspects of the question by stating that the document contains information relevant to the calculation of potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility, including those used for refrigeration and using 100% propane. However, specific calculation methods or formulas for the given scenario are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.",5,"The answer provides detailed descriptions of different types of compressors, specifies requirements for reporting emissions from these compressors, and mentions the use of default emission factors for compressor components in gas service and non-compressor components in gas service. Additionally, the document outlines specific methods for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from reciprocating compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities. The answer also explicitly states that the document contains information relevant to the calculation of potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility, including those used for refrigeration and using 100% propane. Although specific calculation methods or formulas for the given scenario are not explicitly mentioned, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",1,0.2352941176,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions involve using continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and calculating emissions based on the data obtained from CEMS. The intermittent emission from the storage tank is addressed by conducting monitoring at least annually and sampling at least one-third of equipment annually. An alternative method to quantify the emissions is allowed as long as it is documented and meets the applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements. The document also mentions the use of specific equations for calculating emissions from different sources and the use of gas composition monitors for measuring the concentration of specific gases. Additionally, the document provides default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, as well as population emission factors and leaker emission factors for various components and services. These factors can be used in the calculation of emissions from different equipment and components. The tables also include designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states, which may be relevant for determining applicable regulations and emission factors based on location.","The methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions involve using continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and calculating emissions based on the data obtained from CEMS.

It also mentions the use of specific equations and gas composition monitors. Additionally, it provides information on default component counts and emission factors, as well as the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. The answer addresses all important aspects of the question and is therefore highly relevant.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions, as well as the treatment of intermittent emissions and the allowance for alternative methods.

It also includes additional information on specific equations, gas composition monitors, default average component counts, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors.

It also mentions the use of specific equations and gas composition monitors, and provides default emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services.

It specifies the calculation method of flare stacks in paragraph (n) of this section to determine storage tank emissions sent to a flare. Additionally, the document contains tables with emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission compression. These tables can be used to calculate CH4, CO2, and N2O annual emissions if emissions are routed to a flare. The emission factors provided in the tables can be used in conjunction with the calculation method specified in the document to derive the emissions from storage tank venting sent to a flare.","The text mentions the use of flare for transmission storage tank vent stack emissions and provides guidance on calculating CH4, CO2, and N2O annual emissions if emissions are routed to a flare.

So long as a the emergency generators meet the definition of “emergency equipment” as stated in 98.6, emissions from the emergency generators are exempt and should not be calculated.  If the facility is subject to 40 CFR part 98, you should report combustion emissions pursuant to the applicable requirements of subpart C (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).  Pursuant to 40 CFR 98.2, if a facility’s calculated total annual emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons of CO2e and the facility does not contain a source category listed in Table A-3 of 40 CFR part 98, subpart A, then the facility does not have to report under 40 CFR part 98 as a direct emitter.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate description of how a natural gas compressor station determines subpart applicability, including the reporting requirements for emissions, calculation methods for different equipment types, and the use of default emission factors and component counts. The answer also mentions the availability of tables providing default emission factors for different components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S., which can be used to calculate emissions from specific equipment and activities at the facility.",5,"The answer provides a clear and detailed explanation of how a natural gas compressor station determines subpart applicability. It mentions that the document outlines reporting requirements for emissions from various sources, including emergency generators and compressors, and specifies the applicability of different standards and reporting requirements for onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities.

The answer also mentions the availability of default emission factors and calculation methods for different equipment types, as well as tables providing default emission factors for different components and equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S., and average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment.

Additionally, it includes tables with population emission factors, default average component counts, default whole gas leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon emission factors, and default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for different regions and equipment types. However, there is no specific mention of CO2 pipelines or their subjectivity to the Onshore natural gas transmission compression segment under 40 CFR 98 subpart W.","CO2 pipelines are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, the text mainly focuses on the reporting and calculation of CO2 emissions from various sources such as blowdown vent stacks, production process units, injection wells, and equipment leaks. It also provides guidance on calculating the annual mass of CO2, reporting requirements, and methods for measuring the composition of the CO2 stream.

91,Are unintentional natural gas releases such as those resulting from accidental releases subject to reporting?,"The document clearly states that unintentional natural gas releases, including those resulting from accidental releases, are subject to reporting as part of environmental regulations. It specifies reporting requirements for CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from various sources, including well venting, equipment leaks, and flaring. The document also provides calculation methods for determining annual emissions from specific activities such as well venting for liquids unloading and blowdown vent stacks. Additionally, it outlines reporting obligations for different segments of the natural gas industry based on emission levels. Therefore, unintentional natural gas releases are indeed subject to reporting as per the content provided.","The document mentions that vented emissions, including unintentional releases of natural gas, are subject to reporting.

92,How do we report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir?,"The text provides detailed information about underground natural gas storage facilities, including the processes and operations involved, such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. It also discusses the definition of a facility with respect to onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting. The text mentions the reporting requirements for facilities with CO2 production wells and the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations. It also outlines the calculation methods for reporting emissions from onshore production storage tanks and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting storage tanks. However, there is no specific mention of how to report emissions from separate facilities that inject or withdraw gas from the same underground storage reservoir. The provided tables include default emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions, but they do not directly address the specific scenario of reporting emissions from separate facilities sharing the same underground storage reservoir.","The text provides detailed information about underground natural gas storage facilities, including the processes and operations involved, such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement.

It also discusses different types of equipment, such as gas containers, pneumatic pumps, and hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear, as well as methods for calculating emissions from various sources. However, there is no specific mention of high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations. Therefore, based on the provided information, it can be inferred that natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should not be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W. The document also includes tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions, which can be used to calculate emissions from different sources.","The text provides detailed information about various aspects of natural gas storage, processing, and transportation, including LNG storage, onshore natural gas storage, natural gas processing, and onshore natural gas transmission compression.

","High pressure steel bottles that store natural gas at peak-shaving stations without any subsurface storage per section 98.230(a)(5) would not be considered underground natural gas storage under Subpart W.  However, if the high pressure steel bottles are located at underground storage per section 98.230(a)(5) then the equipment leak sources listed in 98.232(f)(5) would be subject to reporting.",,,5,"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context. The context discusses various aspects of natural gas storage, processing, and transportation, including LNG storage, onshore natural gas storage, natural gas processing, and onshore natural gas transmission compression. However, there is no specific mention of high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations. Therefore, based on the provided information, it can be inferred that natural gas stored in high pressure steel bottles at peak-shaving stations should not be considered an underground natural gas storage facility under Subpart W.",1,0.3567567568,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,,,957,,
94,"What is the definition of ""facility"" for underground storage?","The document provides a comprehensive definition of 'facility' for underground storage, particularly for underground natural gas storage. It includes subsurface storage in depleted gas or oil reservoirs and salt dome caverns for load balancing, as well as processes and operations such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement. Additionally, it encompasses wellheads connected to compression units for injecting and recovering natural gas into and from underground reservoirs. The document also mentions the reporting of specific information related to underground natural gas storage, such as quantities, emissions, and storage capacity. Furthermore, it outlines the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for storage stations and wellheads, as well as the calculation of CH4 emissions for storage tanks processing unstabilized crude oil. The provided equations and tables offer further insight into the emission factors and component counts for different equipment and services related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission, which are relevant to understanding the definition of 'facility' for underground storage.","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage, particularly for underground natural gas storage, includes subsurface storage in depleted gas or oil reservoirs and salt dome caverns for load balancing, as well as processes and operations such as compression, dehydration, and flow measurement.

96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"The document provides detailed information about various segments of the natural gas industry, including storage, processing, transmission, and distribution facilities. It outlines reporting requirements for emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O and specific calculation methods for estimating emissions from different equipment and operations. However, it does not directly address why natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment. The document also includes several tables with default emission factors and component counts for different equipment in various regions, such as the Eastern and Western U.S. These tables can be used to calculate emissions based on the equipment and operations involved in each segment. For example, the 'Default Total Hydrocarbon Leaker Emission Factors for Underground Natural Gas Storage' table provides emission factors for different components of storage stations and wellheads, which can be used to estimate emissions from natural gas storage facilities. However, the specific reason for the absence of different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components in natural gas storage facilities is not explicitly addressed in the provided information.","The document provides detailed information about underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and natural gas distribution facilities. It specifies the types of equipment and operations involved in each segment and outlines reporting requirements for emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. It also mentions specific calculation methods for estimating emissions from storage tanks and gathering and boosting equipment. However, it does not directly address why natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.{

}","What constitutes a facility, how to determine the reporting threshold, and reporting of emissions from collocated and dual purpose equipment is as follows: 1) As a first step the reporter must determine the emissions from all equipment listed in 98.232(c) for onshore petroleum and production.  Per section 98.231(a) only sources listed in 98.232(c) need to be considered for threshold determination for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. 98.238 defines “facility” for the purposes of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems.  Per the requirements of 98.3 each “facility” must submit a GHG report for all source categories at that “facility”.  2) Note that while identifying onshore production emissions sources reporters have to determine whether the source is “on the well pad or associated with a well pad”.  The location of production wells within other facilities is inconsequential to this determination.  Sources on a well pad or associated with a well pad across the entire reporting basin have to be taken into consideration.  If your emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production are equal to or greater than 25,000mtCO2e, then onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities report as a separate facility and include all emissions sources listed in 98.232(c).  3) Except for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution, which have unique facility definitions, all other segments subject to subpart W are considered in the threshold determination for a single facility.  You would also include emissions from other source categories at your facility (e.g., stationary combustion).  If there are emissions sources that are dual purpose then the rule requires this piece of equipment to be reported under the majority use industry segment based on guidance provided in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (pp. 1606-1608).  4) For collocated industry segments, which cannot occur in the case of onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution due to the requirements in 98.231(a), EPA has provided guidance on emissions reporting in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14.  Based on the information provided, the facility cannot be reported as onshore production and natural gas processing combined (see point 1 above).  For all the other segments, the report should use guidance in points 2-3 above to determine the segment under which the facility should be categorized.",5,"The answer provides a detailed and accurate description of the document's requirements for reporting emissions from various equipment and activities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and storage, as well as the reporting of emissions from onshore natural gas transmission compression and LNG storage. The answer also mentions the specific calculation methods and factors to be used for estimating emissions from different sources, and highlights the importance of reporting and calculating greenhouse gas emissions, particularly related to the use of CO2 in enhanced oil and gas recovery. Additionally, the answer mentions the availability of tables that can be used to calculate and report emissions from the facility in question.",5,"The answer provides detailed information on how to report emissions from a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recovery and storage.

While the document provides detailed information about underground natural gas storage facilities, it does not explicitly state whether dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are included within the definition of such facilities.

It specifies that facilities are not required to calculate emissions for above grade metering-regulating stations if they do not have above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. Additionally, facilities must report emissions from the natural gas distribution industry segment only if emission sources specified in § 98.232(i) emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The document also includes equations and methodologies for calculating emissions from meter/regulator runs and specifies the conditions under which reporting is required. The provided tables contain default emission factors for various components and equipment used in natural gas distribution, which can be used in the calculation of emissions. These emission factors are essential for determining the CO2 emissions from natural gas combustion and the annual natural gas usage. The tables also include default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and leaker emission factors for various components. The emission factors are expressed in different units such as scf/hour/component, kg CO2/mmBtu, and metric tons, and are used in the calculation of emissions. The document provides a comprehensive guide for facilities to determine whether they are required to report emissions and the methodologies for calculating these emissions.","Natural gas distribution facilities that do not have above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations are not required to calculate emissions for above grade metering-regulating stations and are not required to report GHG emissions in § 98.236(r)(2)(v).

}","For natural gas distribution, a facility, which is the collection of all distribution pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by an LDC, is required to do at least one facility wide leak detection survey per calendar year and has the option to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys; if the facility selects this option, the additional facility-wide survey(s) must be completed during the same calendar year in order to account for fixing one or more leaks in the annual GHG report.  If the facility chooses to fix one or more leaks and conduct another survey to determine that the component is not leaking, it must conduct a facility wide leak detection survey in order to account for fixing the leak(s) in the annual GHG report.  As leaks are random in nature and while some leaks are fixed others are likely to occur.  Therefore, a comprehensive survey is the only statistically relevant manner by which to establish facility-wide leak emissions rates and account for leaks repaired.  Please see the response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1014-9 (Response to Comments, pp. 1281-1282, http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf) for further details.  It is very important to note that the requirement to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys should a company wish to account for fixing a leak does not preclude in any way a company from repairing a leak.  If a company chooses to conduct only one facility-wide leak detection survey in a calendar year but finds a leak during the survey, the company can and is encouraged to fix the leak.  The leak detected though, as noted above, must be reported as a leaker for the entire calendar year should the company choose not to conduct a second survey.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the requirement for at least one leak detection survey to be conducted in a calendar year, and also mentions that multiple surveys can be conducted. The answer also correctly states that facilities do not need to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year. Additionally, the answer provides additional information about tables with emission factors for different components and default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, which shows a good understanding of the topic.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year, and that facilities do not need to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted. The answer also mentions that if multiple surveys are conducted, the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions. The additional information provided about tables with emission factors and survey methods is not directly relevant to the question, but does not detract from the accuracy of the answer.",3,0.3157894737,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides a clear explanation of the minimum number of leak detection surveys required in a calendar year and also mentions that facilities do not need to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted. The answer also provides additional information about tables with emission factors for different components and default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, which can be used to calculate emissions.

111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"The document provides detailed information on the requirements for conducting equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations. It mentions the option for facilities to conduct surveys over multiple years, not exceeding a five-year period, with approximately equal monitoring across all years. This indicates that the EPA recognizes the importance of consistent monitoring over time. The document also outlines the process for requesting extensions to use best available monitoring methods, the approval criteria, and the timing of extension requests, emphasizing the importance of conducting leak surveys and the procedures for requesting extensions or using alternative monitoring methods. The document also includes various emission factors, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for different components and services, providing a comprehensive guide for calculating emissions. These factors are crucial for understanding the environmental impact and determining the necessity of annual leak surveys. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is unlikely that the EPA would provide a sunset provision to eliminate the requirement for annual leak surveys, as consistent monitoring is essential for environmental protection and compliance.","The document provides information on the requirements for conducting equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations.

It also outlines the process for requesting extensions to use best available monitoring methods, the approval criteria, and the timing of extension requests. Additionally, it discusses the calculation of emission factors based on annual surveys and the criteria for using best available monitoring methods beyond specific dates. Overall, the document emphasizes the importance of conducting leak surveys and outlines the procedures and considerations for requesting extensions or using alternative monitoring methods.{

  ","Equipment/component leaks are random in nature and minimal leaks in one year do not guarantee similar leak levels in the future.  There are no sunsetting provisions for individual emissions sources, only facilities.  EPA has provided provisions that allow facilities to stop reporting under certain conditions and with prior notification to EPA.  Please see 40 CFR 98.2(i) (1) – (i) (3).  EPA addressed sunset provisions in general in the proposal to the 2009 Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule (74 FR 16478).",,,5,"The answer provides a thorough explanation of the importance of consistent monitoring over time, the process for requesting extensions or using alternative monitoring methods, and the various emission factors provided in the document.

}","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question, which asks about the consistency of a monitoring plan with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' The answer talks about a requirement to calculate a new average flow rate every other calendar year, which is not directly related to the question.",1,"The answer does not entail the information in the context. The context mentions a requirement to calculate a new average flow rate every other calendar year, which is not related to the monitoring plan described in the question. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the monitoring plan is consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'",2,0.3044619423,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of why the monitoring plan described in the question is not consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' The answer also accurately identifies the requirement for a new average flow rate to be calculated every other calendar year, which further supports the conclusion that the monitoring plan is not consistent with the rule language. Overall, the sentences fit together well and sound natural as a whole, indicating perfect coherency.",769,,
113,What types of instruments are permissible for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W?,No answer found,No context found,"For conducting leak detection required by subpart W, reporters have the option to use optical gas imaging instruments, infrared laser beam illuminated instruments, or acoustic leak detection devices as outlined in 40 CFR 98.234(a).  In addition, reporters may use other instruments, however those instruments must comply with the provisions as stated in 40 CFR 98.234(a)(2).",1,The answer completely lacks relevance as it does not provide any information related to the question or context.,1,"The answer is not present in the context, so it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",1,0.0,5,The answer straightforwardly says that it doesn't know and makes no attempt to answer the question.,1,The answer completely lacks coherence as it does not provide any information related to the question asked.,15,,

It also includes requirements for reporting destruction device excess emissions data for fluorinated gas production facilities. Additionally, the document contains tables with default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. These tables provide emission factors for different components and equipment, which can be used in the calculation of fugitive greenhouse gas emissions under §98.233(q).

Furthermore, the document also includes default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, which can be utilized in the estimation of fugitive greenhouse gas emissions. The emission factors are provided for different survey methods, such as those specified in § 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7).

It provides information about the document discussing CO2 emissions from various stationary fuel combustion sources, including the acid gas removal (AGR) unit, and emphasizes the use of Tier 4 Calculation Methodology for reporting. However, it does not directly address the specific question about whether the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and adjust the emissions downward by the magnitude of CO2 emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.",1,"The provided information does not directly address the specific question about whether the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and adjust the emissions downward by the magnitude of CO2 emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine the exact requirements for the facility in the given scenario.",3,0.4104803493,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the answer does not directly address the specific question, it provides information on the calculation and reporting of CO2 emissions from AGR vents and the adjustment of CO2 emissions if they are recovered and transferred outside the facility. However, it also states that it is not possible to conclusively determine the exact requirements for the facility in the given scenario.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by discussing the calculation and reporting of CO2 emissions from various stationary fuel combustion sources, including the AGR unit, and the adjustment of CO2 emissions if they are recovered and transferred outside the facility.

120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"The document mentioned several calculation methods for estimating emissions from various components in the petroleum and natural gas industry. It also provided default emission factors and component counts for different equipment in the onshore natural gas production and gathering processes. However, there is no specific mention of the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. The document did not provide a direct explanation or formula for estimating emissions downward according to the mentioned provisions.","Facilities performing on-site acid gas injection can estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. The document also mentions the calculation methods for CO2 emissions from acid gas removal units, the reporting requirements for facilities injecting CO2 into subsurface geologic formations, and the need for conducting performance tests for nitric acid production processes.{

}",Reporters performing on-site injection of acid gas may not adjust emissions downward. §98.233(d)(11) clearly states that you may only adjust emissions estimates downwards for emissions recovered and transferred OUTSIDE the facility.  Please see EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-0582-31 in the Response To Comments (pages 1474 - 1476) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf.,2,"The answer mostly lacks relevance as it does not directly address the question about estimating emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. While the answer provides information about calculation methods and default emission factors for various components in the petroleum and natural gas industry, it does not mention the specific provisions mentioned in the question.",1,"The answer states that there is no specific mention of the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility, which contradicts the question. Therefore, the answer is logically false from the information contained in the context.",2,0.2654867257,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,2,"The answer mostly lacks coherence as it provides information about the calculation methods and default emission factors for various components in the petroleum and natural gas industry, but fails to directly address the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.",570,,
121,For AGR vents is the use of a meter to measure flow rates required?,"The document mentions that for AGR vents, the use of a meter to measure flow rates is required. It also provides guidance on the use of continuous gas analyzers or quarterly gas samples if a continuous gas analyzer is not available. Additionally, the document includes tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting, as well as natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground storage, LNG storage, and import/export equipment. These tables provide emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components, which can be used in emission calculations for AGR vents. The document also includes average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, which can be used in conjunction with the emission factors to estimate total emissions from AGR vents. Overall, the document provides comprehensive information on emission calculation methods and factors relevant to AGR vents.","The document mentions calculation methods for determining emissions from AGR vents, including the use of a meter to measure flow rates.

The document specifies that equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section regarding blowdown vent stack emissions. This indicates that the 50 cubic feet refers to the physical container volume, not the gas volume.

The answer also addresses the question directly and provides a clear conclusion based on the information provided in the document.,590,,
124,"May average blowdown volumes be used for industry segments (processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports) where reporting of this emission source is required?","The document provides detailed information about onshore natural gas processing, natural gas transmission, and LNG import-export equipment. It mentions the requirement to report emissions from specific industry segments if they emit a certain amount of CO2 equivalent per year. It also specifies the annual volumes of natural gas received for processing and the quantity of LNG imported or exported in a calendar year. Additionally, it outlines the calculation methods and reporting requirements for various emission sources in different industry segments. However, there is no specific mention of average blowdown volumes for these industry segments, so further information is needed to determine if average blowdown volumes may be used for reporting. The document also includes several tables providing default average component counts and population emission factors for different equipment and industry segments, but none of them directly address the average blowdown volumes. Therefore, without specific information on average blowdown volumes, it is not possible to determine if they may be used for reporting in the mentioned industry segments.","The document provides detailed information about onshore natural gas processing, natural gas transmission, and LNG import-export equipment.

                          ","Pursuant to a May 2013 final rule, Subpart W BAMM requests are due by June 30 of the year prior to the year in which reports are due (the “reporting year”) and for which BAMM is sought.  As June 30, 2013 falls on a weekend, BAMM requests for the 2014 reporting year are due by July 1, 2013.  The totality of the circumstances related to conducting isolation valve measurement on compressors in shutdown depressurized mode if fully explained in a proper Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) request may be considered by EPA to constitute unique or unusual circumstances justifying the use of BAMM.",,,5,"The passage clearly states that the document specifies the requirements for measuring isolation valve leakage at compressors in the not-operating-depressurized mode. It also provides instructions for conducting volumetric emission measurements and continuous monitoring for both centrifugal and reciprocating compressors. Therefore, the answer is logically entailed by the context.",1,0.1642857143,,,5,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the document's specifications for measuring isolation valve leakage at compressors in the not-operating-depressurized mode. It also mentions the methods for performing as found measurements and provides instructions for conducting volumetric emission measurements and continuous monitoring for both centrifugal and reciprocating compressors. Additionally, it includes various tables with data related to population emission factors, default average component counts, designation of Eastern and Western U.S., default whole gas leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon emission factors, default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors, default total hydrocarbon population emission factors, default methane leaker emission factors, and default methane leaker emission factors for liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. The answer is well-organized and all the sentences fit together naturally, making it a perfect example of a coherent answer.",1503,,
126,Will EPA approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of individual compressor vents routed a common manifold?,"The document provides comprehensive guidance on monitoring and measuring emissions from manifolded compressor sources, including centrifugal and reciprocating compressors. It specifies methods for conducting volumetric emission measurements, continuous monitoring, and calculation of GHG emissions for individual compressor sources and manifolded groups. The document also outlines specific equations for calculating annual volumetric GHG emissions associated with each manifolded group of compressor sources. Additionally, it includes requirements for reporting information related to compressor sources and manifolded groups of compressor sources. The text does not explicitly mention the approval of the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold by the EPA. However, it does provide relevant information that could be used to support an application for such approval.","The text provides detailed information on the measurement and monitoring methods for manifolded compressor sources, including centrifugal and reciprocating compressors. It specifies the methods for conducting volumetric emission measurements, continuous monitoring, and calculation of GHG emissions for individual compressor sources and manifolded groups. The text also mentions the use of common vents for manifolded groups of compressor sources and the option to elect for continuous measurement of combined volumetric emissions from the manifolded group of compressor sources. It outlines specific equations for calculating annual volumetric GHG emissions associated with each manifolded group of compressor sources. The document also includes requirements for reporting information related to compressor sources and manifolded groups of compressor sources. Overall, the text provides comprehensive guidance on monitoring and measuring emissions from manifolded compressor sources, which could be relevant to the question about EPA approval for the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold.{

Additionally, it includes several tables with default emission factors and component counts for different regions and equipment types, which can be used in the calculation of emissions.

It also mentions the exemption of tubing systems equal to or less than one half inch diameter from certain reporting requirements. The document contains tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different regions of the U.S., as well as average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment.
