1,Who is required to report under subpart W?,"Facilities subject to subpart W include petroleum and natural gas production facilities, industrial wastewater treatment facilities, and underground coal mines. These facilities are required to report under subpart W. Additionally, facilities that become newly subject to subpart W may use best engineering estimates for data that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart. The document also provides default emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as alternative methods for reporting under certain conditions.","Facilities that are currently subject to subpart W and acquire new sources from another facility that were not previously subject to this subpart may use best engineering estimates for data related to those newly acquired sources. Facilities that become newly subject to subpart W may also use best engineering estimates for data that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of this subpart. There are specific requirements for reporting under subpart W for facilities in different industries such as petroleum and natural gas production, industrial wastewater treatment, underground coal mines, and more. There are also provisions for using alternative methods and discontinuing reporting under certain conditions.{

}","EPA has developed a voluntary screening tool for the petroleum and natural gas source category to assist reporters in their applicability determinations - the ""applicability tool"".  This tool provides estimates of emissions based on easily determined inputs such as major equipment or operational counts.  While the applicability tool is designed to help potential reporters comply with the rule, compliance with all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations remains the sole responsibility of each facility owner or operator subject to those laws and regulations. The applicability tool only serves as a guide to determine those facilities that are clearly well below the reporting threshold, those clearly above, and those close to the threshold who will need to collect further data to make a proper determination.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information about the document's contents related to the assessment of emissions from various components and equipment used in the oil and natural gas industry. However, it does not directly answer whether the EPA will provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule.",1,"The passage explicitly states that it does not mention whether the EPA will provide a tool to assist oil and natural gas system facilities in assessing their applicability under this rule.

4,Do the facility definitions in this rule affect other EPA reporting requirements?,"The facility definitions in the rule have a direct impact on other EPA reporting requirements, especially regarding the reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The definitions provide specific criteria for different types of facilities such as electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting facilities, and natural gas distribution facilities. They also detail the thresholds and conditions for reporting GHG emissions at the facility level, including the reporting of SF6 and PFC emissions. Additionally, the rule outlines specific requirements for reporting GHG emissions from different types of facilities, such as electric power systems, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper manufacturing, and livestock facilities. The provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for various types of facilities, which are essential for calculating and reporting GHG emissions. These tables provide specific values for different components and equipment in different regions, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pumps, which are crucial for determining the emissions from the facilities. Therefore, the facility definitions in the rule directly affect other EPA reporting requirements by providing the necessary parameters and criteria for reporting GHG emissions from different types of facilities.","The facility definitions in the rule have a direct impact on other EPA reporting requirements, especially regarding the reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

6,How is the petroleum and natural gas systems source category defined?,"The petroleum and natural gas systems source category is defined as including petroleum refineries, importers, exporters, natural gas liquids fractionators, and local natural gas distribution companies. It encompasses various sources such as catalytic cracking units, fluid coking units, delayed coking units, catalytic reforming units, coke calcining units, asphalt blowing operations, blowdown systems, storage tanks, process equipment components in gas service, marine vessel loading operations, flares, sulfur recovery plants, non-merchant hydrogen plants, and more. Additionally, it covers industrial waste landfills, petrochemical production, offshore and onshore production facilities, natural gas processing, and gathering and boosting facilities. The category has specific requirements for reporting GHG emissions and includes regulations for monitoring and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) measures. The document also provides equations for calculating fuel mass or volume, high heat value of the fuel, CO2 emission factor, conversion factors, and annual CO2 mass emissions from natural gas combustion. Furthermore, it includes tables with population emission factors for various components, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, default average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and a designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states.","The petroleum and natural gas systems source category consists of petroleum refineries, importers, exporters, natural gas liquids fractionators, and local natural gas distribution companies.

7,Who must report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems)?,"Entities required to report under subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) include reporters who must report specific information related to CO2 and CH4 emissions from various systems and processes as well as the calculation methods used. The reporting obligations include reporting on emissions from ventilation and degasification systems, fluid coking units, on-site sulfur recovery plants, uncontrolled blowdown systems, catalytic cracking units, and more. Additionally, there are specific reporting requirements for petroleum products, natural gas liquids, and biomass. The document also outlines the submission of complete reporting for specific years and the electronic submission format specified by the Administrator. The document mentioned several calculation methods and equations that explain how to derive the emissions from the data. For example, it provides equations for converting units, calculating emission factors, mass of emitted gases, and process emissions from various equipment and processes. It also includes tables that provide default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment.

The document provides various tables with default emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission compression, underground storage, LNG storage, and distribution. These emission factors are used in environmental regulations to calculate and report the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. The provided equations include conversion factors for different units and molecular weights, which are essential for emission calculations. The tables contain emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pneumatic devices, pumps, compressors, meters, flanges, pump seals, and other components, which are crucial for determining the emissions from oil and natural gas system facilities.","Oil and natural gas system facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. The reporting includes gathering and boosting equipment, natural gas processing, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, and onshore natural gas transmission compression.{
    ""result"": ""The equations provided include various conversion factors, emissions factors, and other parameters related to environmental regulations. For example, the equation 1.14 × 10−7 = Conversion factor (lb/dscf-ppm N2O) represents a conversion factor for pounds per dry standard cubic feet to parts per million of N2O. Another equation 44/12 = Ratio of molecular weights, CO2 to carbon, represents the ratio of the molecular weights of CO2 to carbon. The equation 2000/2205 = Conversion factor to convert tons to metric tons represents the conversion factor for tons to metric tons.

9,How are greenhouse gas emissions calculated for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities?,"The document mentioned several methods for calculating greenhouse gas emissions for subpart W (oil and natural gas systems) facilities. It involves identifying fluorinated GHGs with emissions of 1,000 metric tons CO2e or more, reporting total annual emissions across fluorinated GHGs, and calculating emissions using default GWP values. The calculation also requires specific equations for different gases, which are subject to quality assurance and control requirements. Additionally, the document provides detailed emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, including population emission factors and default whole gas leaker emission factors. These factors are used in the equations to calculate emissions for different components and material types in both Eastern and Western U.S. regions.

}","Under this rule, facilities will detect, as applicable, and calculate GHG emissions according to the specified quantification methods. See the table below for a summary of the calculation methodologies by source type. Where volumetric emissions are measured, mass emissions of CO2 and CH4 will be estimated based on the annual mole fraction and density of each GHG. • The engineering calculation methods use monitored process operating parameters and either software models, engineering calculations, or emission factors. • For emissions detection, the rule allows the use of optical gas imaging instruments, organic vapor analyzers (OVA), toxic vapor analyzers (TVA) and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments or acoustic leak detection instruments for accessible components. For inaccessible components, reporters must use an optical gas imaging instrument. • Direct measurement involves the use of the high-volume sampler; or calibrated bagging; or rotameters, turbine meters, or other meters, as appropriate, depending on the individual component for emissions measurement. • For the use of leaking factors, the relevant emission factors will be applied to leaking components determined by using an applicable instrument and applying leaking factors.

}","No. EPA’s intention in posting subpart W calculation utilities is to provide facilities with a simple tool for estimating emissions when determining applicability.  Additionally, the tools include a guidance and source tab to document how emission estimates were calculated.  The utilities are only a guide to help facilities determine their subpart W applicability.  If you suspect a facility may exceed the annual 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold, you should refer to the calculation methodologies in 98.233 to determine emissions.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the provided input does not contain any information about unlocked subpart W screening spreadsheets from the applicability tool. However, it does provide valuable data for calculating emissions and determining applicability under subpart W of the environmental regulations through tables with default emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states.",5,"The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context. The context clearly states that there is no mention of unlocked subpart W screening spreadsheets from the applicability tool in the provided content, but it does provide tables with default emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states.

13,The applicability tool for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas has an operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons. How does this operating factor correlate with the barrels of crude oil produced?,"The provided information does not directly address the correlation between the operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons and the barrels of crude oil produced. However, it does contain relevant tables that provide emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production. These emission factors can be used in conjunction with the operating factor for associated gas venting to estimate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. The correlation between the operating factor and the barrels of crude oil produced may not be explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but it can be inferred that as the production of crude oil increases, the associated gas venting may also increase, leading to higher emissions. Further analysis and calculations using the emission factors and production data would be necessary to establish a more direct correlation.","The text mentions various equipment and activities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission. It explains the definitions of different industry segments, equipment types, and reporting requirements for emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. However, it does not provide specific information about the correlation between the operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons and the barrels of crude oil produced.{

}","EPA has provided guidance on the operating factor in the Notes section, where it states, “This is defined as the fraction of time the process unit is operating in a calendar year.  For example, a 90% operating factor would be entered as 0.9 because the unit is in operation for 90% of the year.”",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by acknowledging that the provided information does not directly address the correlation between the operating factor for associated gas venting from produced hydrocarbons and the barrels of crude oil produced. However, it provides relevant tables that can be used to estimate emissions and suggests that as crude oil production increases, associated gas venting may also increase, leading to higher emissions.

14,Where can I find the screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production?,"The document provides a comprehensive guide for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, including the screening tool. It discusses testing tools for potential effects on current utilization, by-product formation rates, and destruction or removal efficiency values under new conditions. It also outlines the analysis of oil composition and Reid vapor pressure using standard methods published by a consensus-based standards organization. The document further provides methods for determining the gas to oil ratio (GOR) of hydrocarbon production from oil wells, production rate from gas wells, and best available monitoring methods for measurement data. Additionally, it mentions calculation methods for annual CH4 and CO2 emissions from production storage tanks, as well as the use of default whole gas leaker emission factors for components in gas service. The document also outlines the procedures and parameters for calculating flashing emissions and the quantity of CO2 produced from oil or other fluid production wells. The tables provided in the document include population emission factors for various components in different services, default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, default average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering. These tables contain valuable data that can be used for calculations and analysis related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production.","The screening tool for onshore petroleum and natural gas production can be found in the document which discusses the testing of tools for potential effects on current utilization, by-product formation rates, and destruction or removal efficiency values under new conditions.

Additionally, it outlines parameters and calculation methods for different scenarios such as onshore production storage tanks, natural gas transmission compression, atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks, and more. The document also includes equations and methods for estimating cumulative CH4 emissions, excess emissions, and storage tank vented emissions. Finally, the answer correctly states that these details can be used to estimate worst-case scenarios for GHG emissions and determine applicability.

16,"In the applicability tool calculation spreadsheets, why do transmission compression and underground storage differ in the units used for vented emission from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting?","The different units used for vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting in transmission compression and underground storage differ due to the specific default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors and calculation methods used for each type of facility. The emission factors and calculation methods are specified in Table W–3A for onshore natural gas transmission compression and Table W–4A for underground natural gas storage. For onshore natural gas transmission compression, the emission factors are provided for different components such as valve, connector, open-ended line, pressure relief valve, meter or instrument, and other components, with different values for two survey methods (§ 98.234(a)(1) through (6) and Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(7)). Similarly, for underground natural gas storage, the emission factors are provided for different components and survey methods. These differences in emission factors and survey methods contribute to the variation in units used for vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting in transmission compression and underground storage.","The different units used for vented emissions from reciprocating compressor rod-packing venting in transmission compression and underground storage may be due to the specific default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors and calculation methods used for each type of facility, as specified in Table W–3A and Table W–4A to this subpart.{

24,What emissions are reported for petroleum and natural gas systems facilities?,"The document provides detailed information about the emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems facilities. It includes default emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission, storage, LNG facilities, and natural gas distribution. The emission factors are provided for different regions and include factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components. Additionally, the document mentions population emission factors for pneumatic device vents, leaker emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components, and methane emission factors for various equipment in LNG facilities and natural gas distribution. The information also covers the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) for quantifying CO2 mass emissions and the estimation of cover gases and carrier gases emissions. However, it does not contain specific equations or calculation methods for deriving the emissions from the data.","The text contains information about annual CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from venting gas directly to the atmosphere, as well as the calculation methods for these emissions. It also mentions the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) for quantifying CO2 mass emissions and the estimation of cover gases and carrier gases emissions. The document provides details about the emissions calculation, including the use of specific equations and methods for different emission sources. Additionally, it includes the emission thresholds for reporting and the conditions under which emission testing and separate emission factors are required.{

}","EPA does not have an exact estimate of what percent of U.S. emissions are covered under petroleum and natural gas systems at this time.  The petroleum and natural gas systems source category (Subpart W) requires reporting from facilities above an emissions threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e.  It is difficult to quantify what net emissions occurr below the threshold.  In addition, facilities below the threshold may not be directly comparable to facilities over the emission threshold due to differences in the types of emission sources covered.  EPA will continue to analyze the emissions from reports as well as linking the information to the US GHG Inventory to identify what fraction of emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are covered by the GHGRP.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question.

This includes gathering pipelines, separators, compressors, acid gas removal units, dehydrators, pneumatic devices/pumps, storage vessels, engines, boilers, heaters, and flares used in the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas. Additionally, the document provides various equations and emission factors related to the emissions from different components and services in the petroleum and natural gas systems, along with default average component counts for major equipment in different regions of the U.S.","The EPA defines a ""facility"" for petroleum and natural gas systems as all petroleum or natural gas equipment on a single well-pad or associated with a single well-pad and CO2 EOR operations that are under common ownership or control, including leased, rented, or contracted activities by an onshore petroleum and natural gas production owner or operator, and that are located in a single hydrocarbon basin.

}","In order to provide Petroleum and Natural Gas System facilities with time to adjust to the requirements of the GHGRP, EPA made available the optional use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for unique or unusual circumstances.  Where a facility used BAMM, it was required to follow emission calculations specified by the EPA, but was allowed to use alternative methods for determining inputs to calculate emissions.  These inputs are the values used by reporters to calculate equation outputs or results.  Examples of BAMM include monitoring methods used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W), supplier data, engineering calculations, and other company records.  It is not immediately apparent how the use of BAMM affected emissions, because facilities used BAMM in different ways and for different parameters depending on their unique or unusual circumstances.",4,"The answer provides extensive information on the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) and its impact on emissions. It outlines the conditions under which BAMM can be used, such as for specific sources and during certain time periods when it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, or operate required monitoring equipment. The text also discusses requests for extension of the use of BAMM and the approval criteria for such extensions. It mentions that the owner or operator must discontinue using BAMM and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements at specific dates. Additionally, it provides information on monitoring methods and approval criteria, as well as specific reporting provisions for different reporting years. The document outlines various calculation methodologies and equations to be used in conjunction with BAMM, including emission factors, mass calculations, and conversion factors. It also specifies special provisions and criteria for the use of BAMM beyond certain dates.

The answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",3,0.3280757098,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent and provides extensive information on the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) and its impact on emissions. It outlines the conditions under which BAMM can be used, discusses requests for extension of the use of BAMM and the approval criteria for such extensions, and mentions the owner or operator must discontinue using BAMM and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements at specific dates. Additionally, it provides information on monitoring methods and approval criteria, as well as specific reporting provisions for different reporting years. The document outlines various calculation methodologies and equations to be used in conjunction with BAMM, including emission factors, mass calculations, and conversion factors. It also specifies special provisions and criteria for the use of BAMM beyond certain dates. However, the answer could be improved by providing a more direct answer to the question of how BAMM affected emissions.",1262,
32,How does the petroleum and natural gas systems data reported under the GHGRP compare to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB)?,"The document provides detailed information on the calculation methods for deriving GHG emissions from offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as gathering and boosting facilities. It outlines specific emission thresholds for reporting, such as 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year for certain industry segments. Additionally, it specifies the reporting requirements for the annual quantity of petroleum products and natural gas liquids, as well as the need to retain laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used in the estimation of emissions. The document also contains detailed instructions on what needs to be reported and the methods to be used for calculating and monitoring GHG emissions, as well as the necessary record-keeping requirements. Furthermore, it includes various equations and conversion factors for calculating emissions, such as the conversion factor to convert tons to metric tons, the ratio of molecular weights between CO2 and carbon, and specific equations for calculating the mass and emission factors of fluorinated GHGs emitted from process vents. Additionally, the document provides tables with emission factors for different components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, as well as default average component counts for major equipment in these facilities. The tables also include the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states for reference. Therefore, the document offers comprehensive guidance and data for comparing the data reported under the GHGRP to the data reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in terms of monitoring, calculation methods, and specific emission factors.","The data reported under the GHGRP for petroleum and natural gas systems is subject to monitoring and quality assurance requirements specified in various sections. Calculation methods for deriving GHG emissions from offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as gathering and boosting facilities, are outlined in § 98.233. The document also mentions specific emission thresholds for reporting, such as 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year for certain industry segments. Additionally, the reporting requirements include the annual quantity of petroleum products and natural gas liquids, as well as the need to retain laboratory reports, calculations, and worksheets used in the estimation of emissions. It also specifies the reporting of GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas and produced natural gas for various facilities. The document contains detailed instructions on what needs to be reported and the methods to be used for calculating and monitoring GHG emissions, as well as the necessary record-keeping requirements.{

}","The GHGRP covers the same sources of emissions in California as CARB, but there are differences in the reporting thresholds as well as how facilities are defined.  CARB has a different definition for onshore production facilities than the GHGRP.  The practical implication is that individual CARB facilities reporting under onshore production may be larger than comparable GHGRP facilities.  However, there will be more facilities in the GHGRP, and those facilities will cover the same emissions as the smaller number of CARB facilities.  It is not expected that the total emissions covered will be different between the GHGRP and CARB.",4,"The answer provides a detailed description of the information provided in the document, including the calculation methods for deriving GHG emissions, specific emission thresholds for reporting, reporting requirements for the annual quantity of petroleum products and natural gas liquids, and the necessary record-keeping requirements. It also mentions the various equations and conversion factors for calculating emissions, as well as tables with emission factors for different components in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering facilities, and default average component counts for major equipment in these facilities.

33,"What are the notification requirements when an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin?","When an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin, it is important to consider the notification requirements related to the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the equipment, as well as the total gas handled at the offshore platform. The facility must report the information specified in applicable paragraphs of the section related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, including the calculation methods, emission factors, and geographic location. Additionally, it is crucial to consider the regulations and requirements for onshore natural gas transmission pipeline, LNG storage, and gathering and boosting equipment in the context of the specific basin where the sale is taking place. The provided tables contain emission factors, default average component counts, and population emission factors for various equipment and regions, which can be used to calculate the emissions and fulfill the notification requirements as per the environmental regulations.","When an Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production facility, reporting under Subpart W, sells wells and associated equipment in a basin, it is important to consider the notification requirements related to the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the equipment, as well as the total gas handled at the offshore platform.

35,What are the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available?,"The document outlines the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available. It specifies that annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b) if a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available. Additionally, the document provides various calculation methods for different scenarios, such as solid products, fluorinated GHGs, and the mass fraction of CO2 in critical phase EOR injection gas. The document also includes several tables containing population emission factors, leaker emission factors, and default total hydrocarbon emission factors for different components and services related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, transmission compression, underground storage, and LNG storage. These tables provide emission factors for valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other components under different survey methods. The document also designates the Eastern and Western U.S. states and provides emission factors specific to each region. However, the document does not explicitly provide the calculation method for determining the GHG mole fraction when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available. Additional context or clarification is needed to accurately interpret and explain the specific calculation method for determining the GHG mole fraction in the given context.","The document provides requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available.

It specifies that facilities must report emissions if they exceed 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year. Offshore facilities are required to use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods, while onshore facilities must use appropriate default whole gas population emission factors and calculation methods. The text also outlines specific source types for which emissions must be reported and mentions the need to use the appropriate default whole gas leaker emission factors for components. However, the information provided does not directly address the question about whether an offshore facility reported in the GOADS 2008 that did not exceed the combined emissions threshold for subparts C and W sources of more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e would have to report GHG emissions for RY2011 if emissions exceed this threshold.","The text provides definitions for onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as reporting requirements for their GHG emissions. It specifies that facilities must report emissions if they exceed 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year. Offshore facilities are required to use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods, while onshore facilities must use appropriate default whole gas population emission factors and calculation methods. The text also outlines specific source types for which emissions must be reported, and it mentions the need to use the appropriate default whole gas leaker emission factors for components. Given the threshold for reporting emissions and the requirements for both onshore and offshore facilities, it can be inferred that an offshore facility reported in the GOADS 2008 that did not exceed the combined emissions threshold for subparts C and W sources of more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e would not have to report GHG emissions for RY2011 if emissions exceed this threshold.{

}","If emissions in 2011 are 25,000 tons CO2e or more for all sources covered by the greenhouse gas reporting rule, in this case sources under subparts C and W, then the facility must report. §98.233(s)(1)(i) also indicates that if the calendar year does not overlap with the most recent BOEMRE emissions study publication year, the reporter must use the most recent BOEMRE reported emission data and “adjust emissions based on the operating time for the facility relative to the operating time in the most recent BOEMRE published study.”  Therefore, if reported 2008 emissions, adjusted for any differences in 2011 operating time, are 25,000 tons CO2e or more, then the facility must report for calendar year 2011.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question asked about offshore facility emissions reporting thresholds.,1,"The provided answer does not directly address the question asked about whether an offshore facility reported in the GOADS 2008 that did not exceed the combined emissions threshold for subparts C and W sources of more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e would have to report GHG emissions for RY2011 if emissions exceed this threshold. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is true or false without further information.",2,0.3918367347,3,The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question.,3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on the reporting requirements for GHG emissions from onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.

46,"Would an offshore facility that emits 20,000 metric tons CO2e from from subpart W sources based on GOADS calculation methodology and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources be required to report GHG emissions during 2011?","The document mentioned several calculation methods and tables related to emission factors for different components and services. However, it did not directly address the specific question about whether an offshore facility emitting 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011. The provided information mainly focuses on emission factors, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for various components and services related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission. It also includes tables with default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, as well as the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states. However, it does not provide a direct threshold or regulation related to the reporting of GHG emissions for offshore facilities. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the offshore facility would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011.","Based on the information provided, the offshore facility emitting 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would not be required to report GHG emissions during 2011, as the emission threshold for reporting is set at 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year for stationary fuel combustion sources.{

","Yes. The facility is identified as not being in GOADS in 2008, however, the total emissions from the facility is greater than 25,000 metric tons CO2e. §98.233(s)(4) states that “for either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions”.  Also, 98.2(a)(2) (as referenced in 98.231(a)) states that “a facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Tables A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.”  Therefore, based on the information provided, this facility is required to report equipment leaks, vented emissions and flare emissions under subpart W and stationary combustion emissions under subpart C for calendar year 2011.",,,1,"The provided information does not directly address the specific question about whether an offshore facility emitting 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the offshore facility would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011.",1,0.3183183183,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. While the provided information mainly focuses on emission factors and does not provide a direct threshold or regulation related to the reporting of GHG emissions for offshore facilities, the answer attempts to explain why it is not possible to definitively determine whether the offshore facility would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the provided information does not directly address the specific question about whether an offshore facility emitting 20,000 metric tons CO2e from subpart W sources and 10,000 metric tons CO2e from stationary combustion sources would be required to report GHG emissions during 2011. However, it provides information on emission factors, population emission factors, and leaker emission factors for various components and services related to natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and transmission, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, and the designation of Eastern and Western U.S. states.

47,"Can we use 2011 BOEMRE data, rather than the previously available data from 2008, for reporting RY2011 emissions from an offshore petroleum and natural gas production facility?","The document mentioned several calculation methods and tables related to emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. However, there is no specific mention of 2011 BOEMRE data or its suitability for reporting RY2011 emissions. The provided equations and tables include emission factors, conversion factors, and component counts for different equipment and locations. These can be used to estimate emissions based on operating time and specific operating scenarios. The tables also provide population emission factors for different components in Eastern and Western U.S., as well as default average component counts for major equipment in different regions. While the document provides valuable information for estimating emissions, it does not explicitly address the use of 2011 BOEMRE data for reporting RY2011 emissions.","The document outlines the requirement for reporting emissions from offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, including the use of the most recent BOEMRE data for reporting, the adjustment of emissions based on operating time, and the need for approval for using best available monitoring methods. It also specifies the reporting deadlines and methods for estimating emissions for different calendar years. However, there is no specific mention of 2011 BOEMRE data, so it is unclear whether it can be used for reporting RY2011 emissions.{

Offshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from equipment leaks, vented emission, and flare emission source types as identified in the data collection and emissions estimation study conducted by BOEMRE. The calculation and reporting of emissions for both onshore and offshore facilities are to be done using the most recent monitoring methods and calculation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304. The document also provides definitions for various industry segments and equipment types, as well as details on the reporting requirements for different facility types.{

}","Therefore, if the facility is subject to the rule and is under BOEMRE jurisdiction but is a new facility that is not included in the most recently published GOADs report, then you must calculate calendar year 2011 emissions for equipment leaks, vent, and flare emission sources using the GOADS methodologies in the most recently published GOADS report. New facilities, whether or not under GOADS jurisdiction, have to follow 98.233(s)(4), which states, “For either first or subsequent year reporting, offshore facilities either within or outside of BOEMRE jurisdiction that were not covered in the previous BOEMRE data collection cycle shall use the most recent BOEMRE data collection and emissions estimation methods published by BOEMRE referenced in 30 CFR 250.302 through 304 to calculate and report emissions (GOADS) to report emissions.”",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning that offshore facilities subject to GOADS must use the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEMRE to calculate and report annual emissions. It also mentions that if published GOADS data are not available, emissions should be adjusted based on the operating time relative to the most recent BOEMRE study. However, it does not explicitly state how new offshore facilities subject to GOADS are supposed to report in 2012. The answer partially addresses the question but lacks important details.",1,"The answer does not directly address how new offshore facilities subject to GOADS are supposed to report in 2012.

52,Are the emissions factors listed in Table W-1A for both leaking components and non-leaking components? How do you calculate emissions from leaking components if onshore petroleum and natural gas source are not required to monitor components?,"The document provides information on the calculation methods for determining emissions factors for petroleum products and natural gas liquids. It mentions the use of default carbon share factors and CO2 emission factors for different products, as well as the development of site-specific emission factors based on direct measurements of density and carbon share. It also discusses the calculation of fossil fuel-based CO2 emissions and the calculation of site-specific emission factors for processes. However, it does not directly address the calculation of emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources if monitoring is not required. The document also includes tables with default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, as well as default whole gas leaker emission factors for the same facilities. These tables provide emission factors for various components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, and pneumatic pumps, categorized by different regions. The emission factors are given in units of scf/hour/component and vary based on the survey method used. However, the document does not explicitly provide a calculation method for determining emissions from leaking components for onshore petroleum and natural gas sources if monitoring is not required.","The document provides information on the calculation methods for determining emissions factors for petroleum products and natural gas liquids.

}",The 10 barrels per day of oil throughput referenced in 98.233(j) is based on annual average daily throughput.,3,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that the document does not directly mention whether the average throughput of oil in 98.233(j)(1) is an annual or daily average. However, it provides tables with population emission factors for different components and regions, as well as average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment.

54,How should the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks be determined to compare with the threshold of 10 barrels a day in 98.233.j(1)?,"The document provides guidance on how to determine the daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks. It specifies Calculation Method 1 and 2 for flashing emissions calculation from the separator or non-separator equipment, and different methods based on the type of equipment and throughput of oil, respectively. Additionally, for hydrocarbon liquids with throughput less than 10 barrels per day, Calculation Method 3 should be used. The document emphasizes the importance of reporting the total annual oil/condensate throughput from all wells and the number of atmospheric tanks receiving oil. It also includes considerations for emissions adjustments due to malfunctioning dump valves, vapor recovery systems, and flaring. The document does not provide specific equations or calculations for determining the daily oil throughput, but it offers tables with default emission factors and component counts for major onshore natural gas and crude oil production equipment, which can be used in conjunction with the specified calculation methods to derive the emissions.","The daily oil throughput for onshore production storage tanks should be determined by using Calculation Method 1 or 2 as specified in paragraph (j)(1) and (2) of this section. The Calculation Method 1 involves using a software program to calculate flashing emissions from the separator or non-separator equipment, while Calculation Method 2 involves different methods based on the type of equipment and throughput of oil. Additionally, for hydrocarbon liquids with throughput less than 10 barrels per day, Calculation Method 3 should be used. The information in the document provides guidance on how to calculate CH4, CO2, and N2O emissions from atmospheric pressure fixed roof storage tanks, and it emphasizes the importance of reporting the total annual oil/condensate throughput from all wells as well as the number of atmospheric tanks receiving oil. The document also includes considerations for emissions adjustments due to malfunctioning dump valves, vapor recovery systems, and flaring.{

It specifies that facilities must report emissions if certain emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. Additionally, it mentions the use of default whole gas population emission factors listed in Table W–1A for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities. The provided tables include default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment. These tables can be used to calculate emissions from the onshore natural gas production facility, which is relevant to the question about reporting basin emissions under the same facility registration for RY2010 and RY2011.","The document contains detailed definitions and descriptions of onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas transmission compression, offshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, onshore natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission pipeline, and LNG storage. It also mentions that facilities must report emissions from the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment only if emission sources specified in § 98.232(c) emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year, and that facilities must use the appropriate default whole gas population emission factors listed in Table W–1A of this subpart for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities.{

}",Geologic provinces 160 (Appalachian Basin) and 160A (Appalachian Basin-Eastern Overthrust area) are two distinct basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production under Part 98.,,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation that geologic provinces 160 and 160A are considered as separate basins for the purposes of defining a facility for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. The answer also correctly explains that each well in a basin is considered as one facility, and all wells in a basin are considered to be one facility if owned or operated by a single person or entity. This information logically follows from the context provided.",5,0.3669724771,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,5,The answer is perfectly coherent as it directly answers the question and provides clear and concise information from the given context. It also uses specific terms and phrases from the context to support its answer.,518,
62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately assess and regulate the emissions from these facilities. This reporting requirement allows for a more detailed and localized understanding of emissions, enabling targeted regulatory measures to mitigate environmental impact. The provided input also includes tables containing emission factors for different components and regions, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, and pressure relief valves, which are essential for calculating emissions. These tables provide the necessary data for facilities to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions by sub-basin category, as required by the EPA. The detailed emission factors for different components and regions enable a comprehensive assessment of emissions, aligning with the EPA's goal of accurately assessing and regulating emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production.","The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin in order to accurately assess and regulate the emissions from these facilities. The text specifies that for onshore petroleum and natural gas production, facilities are required to report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions by sub-basin category, which is a subdivision of a basin into the unique combination of wells with specific surface coordinates and subsurface completions in different formation types. This reporting requirement allows for a more detailed and localized understanding of emissions, enabling targeted regulatory measures to mitigate environmental impact.{

It also mentions that this reporting requirement allows for a more detailed and localized understanding of emissions, enabling targeted regulatory measures to mitigate environmental impact. The answer also correctly identifies the tables containing emission factors for different components and regions as essential for calculating emissions and reporting CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions by sub-basin category, as required by the EPA. Overall, the answer logically follows from the information contained in the context.",4,0.3076923077,1,"The answer provides a clear and complete explanation of why the EPA required facilities to report by basin, and includes specific details about the reporting requirements and the data needed for accurate reporting.

The answer also mentions the importance of emission factors for different components and regions in calculating emissions and complying with the EPA's reporting requirements. Overall, the answer is easy to follow and provides a comprehensive understanding of the topic.",963,

66,How should a gathering and boosting facility that previously reporting under Subpart C report in RY2016?,"The gathering and boosting facility, which reports under Subpart C, is required to report the quantity of gas received in the calendar year, in thousand standard cubic feet, and the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. Additionally, it must report the annual quantity of CO2 in metric tons that is transferred to each subpart RR facility. The facility is also subject to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements specified in subpart W of this part for equipment leaks and vented emissions of CO2 from surface equipment. The provided tables contain default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, which can be used to calculate the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the facility's operations. These factors and counts can be utilized in conjunction with the reported quantity of gas received to determine the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the facility's stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. The emission factors and component counts can also aid in assessing the annual quantity of CO2 transferred to subpart RR facilities and in complying with the monitoring and QA/QC requirements specified in subpart W for equipment leaks and vented emissions of CO2 from surface equipment.","The gathering and boosting facility must report the quantity of gas received in the calendar year, in thousand standard cubic feet, and the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment.

Additionally, it includes the average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering and boosting equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. The document emphasizes the use of specific calculation methods for the entire calendar year and states that emissions from fuel combusted at these facilities will be reported according to the requirements specified in § 98.236(z) and not according to the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part, indicating that Subpart C emission factors may not be directly applicable for calculating combustion emissions in this context.","Based on the provided information, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities are required to use the appropriate default whole gas leaker factors for components in gas service listed in Table W–1E. Facilities in this industry segment must report emissions if the specified emission sources emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or more per year. The document also explains the concept of a gathering and boosting system, along with the definition of a facility in this context. Additionally, it mentions the calculation methods for determining component counts and emphasizes the use of specific calculation methods for the entire calendar year. However, it is important to note that the document specifically states that emissions from fuel combusted at onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities will be reported according to the requirements specified in § 98.236(z) and not according to the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part, indicating that Subpart C emission factors may not be directly applicable for calculating combustion emissions in this context.{

}","Combustion emissions for the Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting segment are calculated using methods outlined in 40 CFR 98.233(z). Those methods provide flexibility to use Subpart C emission factors if the fuel combusted is natural gas, is pipeline quality, and has a minimum high heat value of 950 Btu per standard cubic foot. If the fuel meets those criteria, then you may use the emission factor for natural gas as listed in 40 CFR Part 98, Subpart C, Table C-1.  See 40 CFR 98.233(z)(1).",1,"The answer does not address the question of whether facilities covered by the Subpart W Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting industry segment can use Subpart C emission factors for calculating combustion emissions. Instead, it provides information on the appropriate default whole gas leaker factors for components in gas service listed in Table W–1E, emission factors for various components in different services and material types in the Eastern and Western U.S. for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting facilities, and the average component counts for major equipment in onshore natural gas production and gathering and boosting equipment in the Eastern and Western U.S. While the answer does mention that emissions from fuel combusted at these facilities will be reported according to the requirements specified in § 98.236(z) and not according to the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part, it does not directly answer the question and therefore lacks relevance.",1,"The document specifically states that emissions from fuel combusted at onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities will be reported according to the requirements specified in § 98.236(z) and not according to the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part, indicating that Subpart C emission factors may not be directly applicable for calculating combustion emissions in this context.",1,0.3304347826,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,5,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation that onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities cannot use Subpart C emission factors for calculating combustion emissions.

72,Under onshore natural gas processing where are vent emissions reported?,"Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported based on the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for all emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control. For onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas liquid for all streams is used. Additionally, the provided tables contain information on default emission factors and component counts for onshore natural gas production equipment, as well as total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression. These tables can be used to calculate and report vent emissions based on the specific equipment and region of operation.","Vent emissions from onshore natural gas processing are reported based on the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for all emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control.

It also includes tables with default emission factors for various components and equipment in different locations. However, there is no specific mention of subpart W or the specific regulation regarding facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and not receiving gaseous form of natural gas containing methane. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to directly determine whether such facilities are subject to subpart W.","Facilities designed solely to fractionate natural gas liquid streams and do not receive a gaseous form of natural gas containing methane are subject to subpart W.

}","The Rule states in §98.230(a) that the onshore natural gas processing industry includes all plants that fractionate, as well as all plants that do not fractionate that have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.  Only those non-fractionating facilities with an annual average throughput of less than 25 MMscf per day would not be subject to reporting under subpart W even if the reporting threshold is triggered in Subpart C.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.",4,"The answer provides a detailed explanation of the reporting thresholds for emissions from onshore natural gas processing plants, including the specific threshold of 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year and the conditions for discontinuing reporting based on consecutive years of lower emissions.

This threshold is mentioned in the context of onshore natural gas processing plants, and these facilities must re-evaluate whether they fall below this threshold annually. The text also provides details on the separation processes involved in natural gas processing, including the forced extraction of natural gas liquids, sulfur and carbon dioxide removal, fractionation of NGLs, and the capture of CO2 separated from natural gas streams. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for different equipment and survey methods, which are relevant for calculating emissions from gas processing facilities. These tables can be used to derive the emissions from the gas processing facilities based on the equipment and survey methods used. The emission factors and component counts can be used in conjunction with the volume of gas processed to calculate the total emissions from the facility. The tables also provide information on different survey methods and their respective emission factors, which can be used to assess and monitor emissions from the gas processing facilities.","The 25 MMscf per day threshold for gas processing facilities is mentioned in the context of onshore natural gas processing plants.

}","However, please note that if, in year 2, your throughput capacity is less than 25 MMscf per day, you are not required to calculate and report GHG emissions from gas processing in year 2.  You would still be required to report other covered emissions at your facility.  This is because gas processing would not be an applicable segment for year 2.  Nevertheless, your facility would still be required to report in year 2, even if facility-wide emissions are less than 25,000mt CO2e, and would continue to report until you meet the criteria in 98.2(i) for ceasing to report.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.  This throughput is re-evaluated annually.  Once you are subject to the rule (e.g., your facility contains a source category listed in Table A-4), your facility must continue complying with all the requirements of this part, even if the facility does not meet the applicability requirements in a future year (i.e., 25,000 mtCO2e for petroleum and natural gas systems). The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the basis for the 25 MMscf per day threshold for gas processing facilities in 98.230(a)(3) and how often a facility must re-evaluate whether it falls below this threshold.

It emphasizes that in case of a conflict, the requirements of the applicable subpart take precedence. The text also highlights the use of best engineering estimates for data related to newly acquired sources and the reevaluation of applicability requirements in case of any changes such as process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, etc. It provides specific default emission factors for different types of facilities and emphasizes the responsibility to comply with the requirements of Subpart W, including reporting annual GHG emissions. Additionally, it states that facilities must report GHG emissions under Subpart W if they meet the applicability requirements of §§ 98.2(a)(1), 98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3). The provided tables include default emission factors for different components and equipment, as well as population emission factors for onshore natural gas transmission compression.","The 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3)) are both important in determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility. The text emphasizes the need to follow the requirements of the applicable subparts of the part, and in case of a conflict, the requirements of the applicable subpart take precedence. It also mentions the use of best engineering estimates for data related to newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according to the requirements of Subpart W, and the reevaluation of applicability requirements in case of any changes such as process modifications, increases in operating hours, increases in production, etc. It also provides specific default emission factors for different types of facilities and emphasizes the responsibility to comply with the requirements of Subpart W, including reporting annual GHG emissions.

}","Since the throughput of the facility was identified in the question as 30 MMscf per day throughput capacity, this exceeds the exclusion identified in the §98.230(a)(3) for processing facilities that do not fractionate.  Therefore, this facility falls under the onshore natural gas processing industry segment definition as defined in §98.230(a)(3) and these emissions would be included in the applicability determination for your facility.  (If the throughput were less than 25 MMscf this source would not have been considered in the applicability determination for the facility.)  However, based on the information provided, since the processing facility has less than 25,000 metric tons CO2e in combined emissions from stationary combustion, flaring, vented, and fugitive sources, the facility does not need to report under subpart W.  Both the 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold (from §98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day annual average throughput (from §98.230(a)(3)) are considered when determining subpart W applicability for a natural gas processing facility.",5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate response to the question by correctly identifying that both the 25,000 MT CO2e threshold (under 98.2(a)(2)) and the 25 MMscf per day throughput (under 98.230(a)(3)) are important in determining the Subpart W applicability of a natural gas processing facility. It also correctly highlights that in case of a conflict, the requirements of the applicable subpart take precedence.

81,May engineering calculations be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product?,"The document mentions that engineering calculations may be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product. It also discusses the use of continuous gas composition analyzers, calculation methods for flare stack emissions, and methods for estimating the carbon content and higher heating value of flare gas. Additionally, it provides default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment, average component counts for major crude oil production equipment, and population emission factors for various gas services. These factors and counts can be used in the engineering calculations for flare gas composition and emissions estimation.","Engineering calculations may be used for flare gas composition in equations W-19 through W-21 if the flared stream is a combination of gases from before and after the demethanizer as well as hydrocarbon product.

83,"Under subpart W, are we required to calculate potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane?","The document provides detailed guidance on calculating and reporting GHG emissions, including fluorinated GHGs, from various production and transformation processes at a facility. It outlines specific requirements for identifying and reporting fluorinated GHGs with emissions of 1,000 metric tons CO2e or more, as well as those with total emissions less than 1,000 metric tons CO2e. Additionally, it addresses the calculation and reporting of specific GHGs, such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, from certain equipment and processes. However, it does not directly mention the calculation of potential GHG emissions from compressors at a natural gas processing facility that are only used for refrigeration and use 100% propane. The provided tables contain emission factors for various components and equipment in onshore natural gas processing plants, which could be used in the calculation of potential GHG emissions. However, the specific calculation method for the given scenario is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content.","The document contains information on calculating and reporting GHG emissions, including fluorinated GHGs, from various production and transformation processes at a facility. It outlines specific requirements for identifying and reporting fluorinated GHGs with emissions of 1,000 metric tons CO2e or more, as well as those with total emissions less than 1,000 metric tons CO2e. The document also provides methods for calculating total annual emissions across fluorinated GHGs for the entire facility using default GWP values. Additionally, it addresses the calculation and reporting of specific GHGs, such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, from certain equipment and processes.

It also mentions the use of specific methods and industry standard practices for emission calculations. However, the answer does not directly address the definition of fractionation or its absence within the rule. The answer also includes tables with default emission factors and component counts for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment, as well as leaker emission factors for onshore natural gas processing and transmission compression.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The document specifies two methods, 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1), for monitoring tank emissions. Both methods require continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) to quantify emissions. The intermittent emission from the storage tank can be treated by calculating the weekly CH4 liberated from the mine using CH4 measured weekly or more frequently, CH4 content, flow rate, temperature, pressure, and moisture content, and Equation FF–3 of this section. An alternative method to quantify emissions may be used if it complies with the requirements specified in the document. Additionally, the document provides default emission factors and component counts for various equipment and survey methods, which can be used to quantify emissions in different scenarios.","The methods for monitoring tank emissions are specified in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1).

","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",,,5,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the two methods specified in the document for monitoring tank emissions, as well as how to treat intermittent emissions and the possibility of using alternative methods. The answer also mentions the availability of default emission factors and component counts for different scenarios, which shows a good understanding of the context.",1,0.2555910543,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to all three questions without any uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear and coherent explanation of the two methods specified in the document for monitoring tank emissions, as well as how to treat intermittent emissions and the possibility of using alternative methods. The answer also mentions the availability of default emission factors and component counts for different scenarios, which adds to its coherence.",759,
86,"For transmission tank venting sent to the flare, the reporter is referred to the emissions source for flare stack emissions, but guidance is only provided for upstream production and gas processing in this section.","The document provides information about the reporting requirements and monitoring methods for transmission storage tank vent stack emissions, including the indication of a flare attached to the vent stack. It also outlines the calculation methods for CH4, CO2, and N2O emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage when routed to a flare. However, the specific guidance for transmission tank venting sent to the flare is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The text mainly focuses on emission factors, component counts, and survey methods for various equipment and components in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering processes. The tables provide detailed data on population emission factors, default average component counts, and leaker emission factors for different equipment and material types in the Eastern and Western U.S. regions. The information is comprehensive but does not directly address the specific guidance for transmission tank venting sent to the flare.","The text provides information about the reporting requirements and monitoring methods for transmission storage tank vent stack emissions, including the indication of a flare attached to the vent stack and the reporting of specific information in case of scrubber dump valve leakage.

It accurately mentions that onshore natural gas transmission compression includes any stationary combination of compressors that move natural gas at elevated pressure from production fields, natural gas processing plants, or other transmission compressors through transmission pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage. The answer also discusses the reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from these facilities, as well as the use of default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components in gas service. Additionally, it outlines the methods for calculating emissions from reciprocating compressor venting at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities using Equation W–29D. The provided tables include population emission factors for different components in gas service, light crude service, and heavy crude service, as well as default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. Furthermore, it presents default total hydrocarbon emission factors for onshore natural gas processing plants and onshore natural gas transmission compression, along with survey methods and leaker emission factors for various components under different survey methods.",5,"The given text clearly states that onshore natural gas transmission compression includes any stationary combination of compressors that move natural gas at elevated pressure from production fields, natural gas processing plants, or other transmission compressors through transmission pipelines to natural gas distribution pipelines, LNG storage facilities, or into underground storage.

89,How does a natural gas compressor station that operates compressors for natural gas transmission and an emergency generator determine subpart applicability?,"The natural gas compressor station determines subpart applicability based on the type of equipment and activities specified in the regulations. It needs to report the information specified in the applicable paragraphs of the regulations and may need to use specific calculation methods for calculating GHG emissions. The station must also indicate whether any equipment components are subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards and may need to use specific calculation methods for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from reciprocating compressor venting. Additionally, the station may need to use specific default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components and report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. It is important for the station to understand and comply with the specific reporting requirements and calculation methods outlined in the regulations to determine subpart applicability.","A natural gas compressor station determines subpart applicability based on the type of equipment and activities specified in the regulations.

So long as a the emergency generators meet the definition of “emergency equipment” as stated in 98.6, emissions from the emergency generators are exempt and should not be calculated.  If the facility is subject to 40 CFR part 98, you should report combustion emissions pursuant to the applicable requirements of subpart C (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).  Pursuant to 40 CFR 98.2, if a facility’s calculated total annual emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons of CO2e and the facility does not contain a source category listed in Table A-3 of 40 CFR part 98, subpart A, then the facility does not have to report under 40 CFR part 98 as a direct emitter.",,,5,The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how a natural gas compressor station determines subpart applicability based on the type of equipment and activities specified in the regulations. It also mentions the specific reporting requirements and calculation methods that the station needs to comply with to determine subpart applicability.,1,0.2723735409,1,"The answer provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of how a natural gas compressor station determines subpart applicability, without any uncertainty or lack of knowledge.",4,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of how a natural gas compressor station determines subpart applicability based on the type of equipment and activities specified in the regulations. It also mentions the need to report the information specified in the applicable paragraphs of the regulations, indicate whether any equipment components are subject to the well site or compressor station fugitive emissions standards, and use specific calculation methods for calculating GHG emissions and volumetric GHG emissions from reciprocating compressor venting. Additionally, it mentions the need to use specific default total hydrocarbon leaker emission factors for compressor components and report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from stationary or portable fuel combustion equipment. The answer is mostly coherent and the sentences fit together well, although there is some room for improvement in terms of natural flow and organization.",996,
90,Are CO2 pipelines subject to the Onshore natural gas transmission compression segment under 40 CFR 98 subpart W?,"The document provides detailed information on regulations and reporting requirements for CO2 emissions from various sources, including onshore natural gas transmission pipelines. It outlines procedures for reporting CO2 emissions from different activities such as blowdown vent stacks, injection of CO2 for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery, and geologic sequestration of CO2. Additionally, it specifies methods for measuring CO2 emissions and criteria for reporting the annual mass of CO2 received by pipelines. However, the document does not explicitly mention whether CO2 pipelines are subject to the Onshore natural gas transmission compression segment under 40 CFR 98 subpart W. The provided equations and tables offer insights into emission factors, conversion factors, and population emission factors for different components and services related to natural gas production and transmission. These details can be used to calculate and analyze CO2 emissions from various sources within the natural gas industry.","The document mentions the regulations and reporting requirements for CO2 emissions from various sources including onshore natural gas transmission pipelines.

94,"What is the definition of ""facility"" for underground storage?","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage is any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas. The definition also includes specific guidelines for different types of facilities such as electric power systems, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas distribution, carbon dioxide production well facility, cement production, ethanol plant, refining facilities, and more. Additionally, the provided tables contain emission factors and component counts for various equipment and facilities related to onshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas processing, transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, and LNG storage. These tables provide specific emission factors for different components and survey methods, which are essential for calculating emissions from these facilities.","The definition of 'facility' for underground storage is any physical property, plant, building, structure, source, or stationary equipment located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other public right-of-way and under common ownership or common control, that emits or may emit any greenhouse gas.

It states that separate emission reports should be submitted by the respective operators of the underground storage facility and the second company that jointly owns and operates the storage wellheads, as they are subject to specific reporting requirements for emissions and have different emission factors for their respective components.",5,"The provided answer logically follows from the information contained in the context. It explicitly states that separate emission reports should be submitted by the respective operators of the underground storage facility and the second company that jointly owns and operates the storage wellheads, as they are subject to specific reporting requirements for emissions and have different emission factors for their respective components.",2,0.2528735632,1,The answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty.,4,"The answer provides a clear and concise explanation that separate emission reports should be submitted by the respective operators of the underground storage facility and the second company that jointly owns and operates the storage wellheads, as they are subject to specific reporting requirements for emissions and have different emission factors for their respective components.

96,Why do natural gas storage facilities not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.,"The natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment because the emission factors for different components in the natural gas storage facilities are based on the type of service (gas or liquid) and the specific equipment involved. The provided tables and emission factors indicate that the emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components are differentiated based on the type of service and the specific equipment, such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, meters, and in-line heaters. For example, the 'Default Total Hydrocarbon Emission Factors for Onshore Natural Gas Processing' table provides separate emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components in gas service. Similarly, the 'Default Whole Gas Leaker Emission Factors for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production and Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting' table also provides emission factors for different components. Therefore, the differentiation in emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components is already accounted for in the provided emission factor tables based on the specific equipment and type of service, which eliminates the need for separate emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components in natural gas storage facilities.","The text provides information about underground natural gas storage facilities, LNG storage, natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and natural gas distribution. It mentions the annual volumes of natural gas added to and withdrawn from storage, as well as the emission factors for different components in each segment. However, it does not explicitly explain why natural gas storage facilities do not have different emission factors for compressor and non-compressor components like those for the natural gas transmission segment.{

}","What constitutes a facility, how to determine the reporting threshold, and reporting of emissions from collocated and dual purpose equipment is as follows: 1) As a first step the reporter must determine the emissions from all equipment listed in 98.232(c) for onshore petroleum and production.  Per section 98.231(a) only sources listed in 98.232(c) need to be considered for threshold determination for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. 98.238 defines “facility” for the purposes of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems.  Per the requirements of 98.3 each “facility” must submit a GHG report for all source categories at that “facility”.  2) Note that while identifying onshore production emissions sources reporters have to determine whether the source is “on the well pad or associated with a well pad”.  The location of production wells within other facilities is inconsequential to this determination.  Sources on a well pad or associated with a well pad across the entire reporting basin have to be taken into consideration.  If your emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production are equal to or greater than 25,000mtCO2e, then onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities report as a separate facility and include all emissions sources listed in 98.232(c).  3) Except for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution, which have unique facility definitions, all other segments subject to subpart W are considered in the threshold determination for a single facility.  You would also include emissions from other source categories at your facility (e.g., stationary combustion).  If there are emissions sources that are dual purpose then the rule requires this piece of equipment to be reported under the majority use industry segment based on guidance provided in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (pp. 1606-1608).  4) For collocated industry segments, which cannot occur in the case of onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution due to the requirements in 98.231(a), EPA has provided guidance on emissions reporting in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14.  Based on the information provided, the facility cannot be reported as onshore production and natural gas processing combined (see point 1 above).  For all the other segments, the report should use guidance in points 2-3 above to determine the segment under which the facility should be categorized.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory framework and reporting obligations for facilities involved in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas storage, and related activities.

102,Do I have to calculate emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting at LNG storage facilities or LNG import or export terminals?,"The document provides detailed information on the calculation methods for deriving CH4 and CO2 emissions from various sources, including onshore production storage tanks, LNG storage facilities, and well venting for liquids unloading. It emphasizes the use of software programs such as AspenTech HYSYS® or API 4697 E&P Tank for calculating flashing emissions from onshore production storage tanks and the need to use operating conditions and engineering estimates to characterize emissions. Specifically, the document highlights the requirement to calculate emissions from LNG storage facilities and provides default methane leaker emission factors for such facilities. This indicates that calculating emissions from operational LNG storage tank venting is indeed a crucial aspect of environmental regulations.","The document provides calculation methods for deriving CH4 and CO2 emissions from various sources, including onshore production storage tanks, LNG storage facilities, and well venting for liquids unloading.

107,"Are LNG storage sites located adjacent to subpart D facilities under ""common control"" required to report emissions under the subpart D ""facility"" or should the LDC report the emissions under subpart W?","The document mentioned that LNG storage sites located adjacent to subpart D facilities under 'common control' are required to report emissions under the subpart D 'facility'. This is because the definition of facility with respect to natural gas distribution for reporting under subpart D and for the corresponding subpart A requirements includes all distribution pipelines and metering-regulating stations operated by a Local Distribution Company (LDC) within a single state. Additionally, for facilities in LNG storage, the appropriate default methane leaker emission factors for LNG storage components in LNG service or gas service must be used, as listed in Table W–5A to subpart W. Therefore, the LDC should report the emissions under subpart D 'facility' as per the requirements specified in the provided text. The document also provides various equations and tables related to emission factors, component counts, and survey methods for calculating emissions, which can be used for further analysis and calculations.","The LNG storage sites located adjacent to subpart D facilities under 'common control' are required to report emissions under the subpart D 'facility', as the definition of facility with respect to natural gas distribution for reporting under this subpart and for the corresponding subpart A requirements includes all distribution pipelines and metering-regulating stations operated by a Local Distribution Company (LDC) within a single state.

109,Are natural gas distribution facilities required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulator(s) under §98.232(i )?,"The document mentioned that natural gas distribution facilities are required to report emissions from specific equipment and components, such as transmission-distribution transfer stations, metering-regulating stations, and above grade stations. It also outlines the calculation methods and criteria for reporting emissions from natural gas distribution facilities under §98.232(i). The text emphasizes the need for facilities to perform equipment leak surveys and report specific information related to natural gas distribution. Additionally, the document provides population emission factors for various components such as connectors, block valves, control valves, pressure relief valves, orifice meters, regulators, and open-ended lines. It also includes default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment. Therefore, based on the information provided, natural gas distribution facilities are indeed required to report emissions from residential and commercial customer meters and associated regulators under §98.232(i).","The text provides information that natural gas distribution facilities are required to report emissions from specific equipment and components, such as transmission-distribution transfer stations, metering-regulating stations, and above grade stations.

Must a facility indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year?,"The document specifies that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year. If multiple surveys are conducted, the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions. The number of surveys to be conducted in a year does not need to be indicated in advance. The document also provides guidance on conducting leak surveys across a multiple year cycle and reporting the number of years in the cycle. It outlines specific requirements for different components and equipment types, including exemptions based on gas content and tubing system diameter. Additionally, it mentions the use of specific methods for calculating equipment leak emissions, such as the procedures specified in paragraph (q)(2) of this section and Equation W-30.

}","For natural gas distribution, a facility, which is the collection of all distribution pipelines, metering stations, and regulating stations that are operated by an LDC, is required to do at least one facility wide leak detection survey per calendar year and has the option to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys; if the facility selects this option, the additional facility-wide survey(s) must be completed during the same calendar year in order to account for fixing one or more leaks in the annual GHG report.  If the facility chooses to fix one or more leaks and conduct another survey to determine that the component is not leaking, it must conduct a facility wide leak detection survey in order to account for fixing the leak(s) in the annual GHG report.  As leaks are random in nature and while some leaks are fixed others are likely to occur.  Therefore, a comprehensive survey is the only statistically relevant manner by which to establish facility-wide leak emissions rates and account for leaks repaired.  Please see the response to comment EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1014-9 (Response to Comments, pp. 1281-1282, http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf) for further details.  It is very important to note that the requirement to conduct additional facility-wide leak detection surveys should a company wish to account for fixing a leak does not preclude in any way a company from repairing a leak.  If a company chooses to conduct only one facility-wide leak detection survey in a calendar year but finds a leak during the survey, the company can and is encouraged to fix the leak.  The leak detected though, as noted above, must be reported as a leaker for the entire calendar year should the company choose not to conduct a second survey.",,,5,The answer states that at least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year and that the number of surveys to be conducted in a year does not need to be indicated in advance. This follows logically from the information contained in the context.,2,0.2751322751,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent and provides a clear explanation of the requirements for conducting leak detection surveys. It also addresses the question of whether a facility needs to indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in a year, stating that this is not necessary. However, the answer does not explicitly state a specific number of surveys that must be conducted in a calendar year, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score.",879,
111,What happens if an LDC goes out to a custody transfer city gate station year after year and finds that it has no leaking components?  Could EPA provide a sunset provision so that annual leak surveys would no longer be required?,"The document mentions the process for conducting equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years and the requirement to calculate the emission factor 'EFs,MR,i' annually. It also discusses the possibility of requesting extensions for the use of best available monitoring methods, with specific deadlines and approval criteria. However, there is no specific mention of a sunset provision for annual leak surveys. The document also provides tables with population emission factors, default average component counts, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. These tables can be used to calculate the emission factors for different components based on the survey methods specified in the document.","The document mentions the process for conducting equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years and the requirement to calculate the emission factor 'EFs,MR,i' annually.

}","Equipment/component leaks are random in nature and minimal leaks in one year do not guarantee similar leak levels in the future.  There are no sunsetting provisions for individual emissions sources, only facilities.  EPA has provided provisions that allow facilities to stop reporting under certain conditions and with prior notification to EPA.  Please see 40 CFR 98.2(i) (1) – (i) (3).  EPA addressed sunset provisions in general in the proposal to the 2009 Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule (74 FR 16478).",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the process for conducting equipment leak surveys at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years and the possibility of requesting extensions for the use of best available monitoring methods. However, it does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether EPA can provide a sunset provision for annual leak surveys.",1,"The answer does not provide a direct answer to the question asked. It only discusses the process for conducting equipment leak surveys and the possibility of requesting extensions, but does not mention anything about a sunset provision for annual leak surveys.",1,0.1368421053,2,The answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question.,4,"The answer is mostly coherent as it provides information about the process for conducting equipment leak surveys, the requirement to calculate the emission factor annually, and the possibility of requesting extensions for the use of best available monitoring methods. It also mentions the absence of a sunset provision for annual leak surveys and provides tables with population emission factors, default average component counts, and default whole gas leaker emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering equipment in both Eastern and Western U.S. However, the answer could be more concise and focused on directly answering the question.",858,
112,"Would a monitoring plan that results in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4 and 20% in year five, be consistent with the rule language of ""approximately equal across all years in the cycle.""","The document mentioned several calculation methods which explain how to derive the emission from the data. The equations describe various factors and conversion methods used in calculating the emissions. Additionally, there are tables provided that contain emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission compression, and underground storage. These tables provide specific emission factors for different locations and survey methods. However, the document does not directly address the specific monitoring percentages mentioned in the question, and therefore, does not provide a clear answer to whether a monitoring plan resulting in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year five, would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'","The document contains multiple references to the GHG Monitoring Plan as described in § 98.3(g)(5), which outlines the requirements for monitoring plans and the timing of their completion. It also mentions the need for revision of the GHG Monitoring Plan as needed to reflect changes in production processes, monitoring instrumentation, and quality assurance procedures. However, it does not directly address the specific monitoring percentages mentioned in the question, and therefore, does not provide a clear answer to whether a monitoring plan resulting in 10% of stations being monitored in each of years 1 and 2, 40% in year 3, 20% in year 4, and 20% in year five, would be consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'{

}","As noted in the preamble, the purpose of this provision was to reduce burden for reporters, including the option to better align survey frequencies between the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and Department of Transportation regulations.  The statement in the preamble regarding a “minimum of 20 percent of their total number of stations being leak surveyed annually” was considered for cases where a facility chose a period of less than 5 years. We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,"The answer completely lacks relevance to the question, which asks about the consistency of a monitoring plan with a specific rule language. The answer provides information about calculation methods and emission factors for different components and equipment in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, processing, transmission compression, and underground storage, but does not address the specific question asked.",1,"The answer does not provide a clear answer to the question asked. It only explains the contents of the document and the different calculation methods and tables provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the monitoring plan described in the question is consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'",1,0.2734177215,3,"The answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question. Although the answer does not directly address the specific monitoring percentages mentioned in the question, it provides information on how to derive emissions from data and provides specific emission factors for different locations and survey methods.",3,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on the document's contents, but it does not directly answer the question about whether the monitoring plan is consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.' Therefore, the coherence of the answer is partially coherent.",945,
113,What types of instruments are permissible for use in detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W?,"The permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include acoustic leak detection devices and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments. The acoustic leak detection device must be used to detect through-valve leakage, and if a leak of 3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated, a leak is detected. The instrument manufacturer's calculation methods must be used to quantify the through-valve leak. Additionally, an infrared laser beam illuminated instrument can be used for equipment leak detection, and any emissions detected by it are considered a leak unless screened with Method 21 monitoring, where 10,000 ppm or greater is designated a leak.","The permissible instruments for detecting equipment leaks and through valve leakage in Subpart W include acoustic leak detection devices and infrared laser beam illuminated instruments.

}","With regards to acid gas injection wells and subparts PP and UU, please see the response to EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-0582-31 in the Response to Comments (pages 1474 - 1476) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf.  EPA requires reporters to calculate emissions from AGR units and then adjust them downwards by the amount transferred outside of the facility.  Therefore, if 100% of the CO2 recovered from an AGR unit is transferred outside of the facility, then CO2 emissions from the AGR unit must be calculated prior to determining the amount being transferred outside the facility.  Note that §98.236(c)(3) requires separate reporting of both the AGR emissions and emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility, even if the values are the same.",4,"The answer provides relevant information about the regulations and calculation methods for CO2 emissions from AGR vents, as well as the reporting requirements for different types of facilities. However, it does not directly answer the question about whether the facility still needs to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11) and then 'reduce' the emission to zero if all of the emissions from an AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside of the facility.",5,"The answer clearly states that if CO2 emissions from the AGR unit are recovered and transferred outside the facility, the emissions estimated in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(10) should be adjusted downward by the magnitude of CO2 emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility. Therefore, the emissions would be reduced to zero and the facility would not need to calculate emissions pursuant to Section 98.233(d)(11). The answer also provides additional information on the calculation methods, emission factors, and reporting requirements for different types of facilities, which supports the accuracy of the answer.",2,0.3906976744,1,The answer provides a clear and direct response to the question without any uncertainty.,5,"The answer is perfectly coherent and provides a clear and accurate explanation of the regulations regarding the calculation and reporting of CO2 emissions from AGR units. It also references the relevant sections, equations, and tables in the document to support the explanation.",889,
120,Can facilities performing on-site acid gas injection estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility?,"The document provides detailed information on the calculation methods for estimating emissions from various processes and equipment in the context of environmental regulations. It discusses the use of continuous gas analyzers, quarterly gas samples, and specific software programs for calculating emissions from different sources such as glycol dehydrators, onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering and boosting equipment, natural gas processing plants, transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG import and export equipment, and natural gas distribution. The document also includes various equations and conversion factors for calculating emissions, as well as default whole gas emission factors, average component counts, total hydrocarbon emission factors, methane leaker emission factors, and methane population emission factors for different equipment and processes. Therefore, facilities performing on-site acid gas injection may need to follow these calculation methods to estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.","The document mentions provisions for calculating emissions for CO2 vented directly to the atmosphere or emitted through a flare using specific calculation methods. It also discusses the injection of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery, and the monitoring of CH4 emissions from degasification systems. The calculation methods involve the use of continuous gas analyzers or taking quarterly gas samples from the vent gas stream, and the use of specific software programs for calculating emissions from glycol dehydrators. Therefore, facilities performing on-site acid gas injection may need to follow these calculation methods to estimate their emissions downward according to the provisions in 98.233(d)(11) for AGR unit emissions recovered and transferred outside the facility.{

}",Reporters performing on-site injection of acid gas may not adjust emissions downward. §98.233(d)(11) clearly states that you may only adjust emissions estimates downwards for emissions recovered and transferred OUTSIDE the facility.  Please see EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-0582-31 in the Response To Comments (pages 1474 - 1476) http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/documents/pdf/2010/Subpart-W_RTC_part2.pdf.,4,"The answer provides detailed information on the calculation methods for estimating emissions from various processes and equipment, including on-site acid gas injection.

It specifies that the emissions need to be calculated for CO2 only, not CH4, vented directly to the atmosphere or emitted through a flare, engine, or sulfur recovery plant. The document also discusses the requirement to install a continuous gas analyzer or take quarterly gas samples from the vent gas stream for each quarter that the AGR unit is operating to determine CO2 levels for calculation purposes. It defines AGR unit and dehydrator vent emissions, and provides guidance on developing adjusted process-vent-specific emission factors for processes with multiple operating scenarios.

The answer also provides additional information about the calculation of CO2 and CH4 emissions from blowdown vent stacks, the use of flow meters for measuring emissions, and the reporting requirements for blowdown vent stacks. Although the text does not explicitly provide a calculation or measure for the 50 cubic feet volume, the answer clarifies that the reference is to the physical volume of the equipment.",5,The answer provides a clear and logical explanation that the 50 cubic feet refers to the physical volume of the equipment rather than the gas volume.

It outlines methods for determining emissions using flow meters and specifies requirements for different equipment or event types. The document also mentions the calculation of annual CO2 and CH4 emissions from blowdown vent stacks using flow meters, as well as the calculation of total annual emissions for each equipment or event type by summing the mass emissions for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment or event type. Therefore, the average blowdown volumes for industry segments may be used for reporting of this emission source, provided that the specified methods and requirements are followed. Additionally, the document contains tables with default emission factors and average component counts for different regions and equipment types, which can be used in the calculation of emissions for industry segments such as processing, transmission, and LNG imports-exports.","The document provides detailed guidelines for calculating CO2 and CH4 blowdown vent stack emissions from the depressurization of equipment.

125,Will EPA approve the use of BAMM relating to the measurement of isolation valves at compressors in the shut down depressurized mode that are to be measured at least once every three calendar years?,"The document provides information on the minimum frequency of measurement and analysis for various environmental regulations. It specifies that the measurement and analysis should be done annually for most cases, but semiannually for natural gas. Additionally, it outlines the requirement for a triennial (every 3 years) technology assessment report for semiconductor manufacturing facilities emitting more than 40,000 metric ton CO2e of GHG emissions. The document also discusses the timing of extension requests for the use of best available monitoring methods and the approval criteria for such requests. Furthermore, it outlines the requirements for sampling and analysis for different types of compressors and fuels, as well as the recalibration frequency for gas flow meters. The provided tables contain emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and processing, as well as for natural gas transmission compression, LNG storage, LNG import and export equipment, and natural gas distribution. These emission factors are crucial for calculating the emissions from different equipment and components, which is essential for regulatory compliance and environmental impact assessment.","The document mentions the minimum frequency of measurement and analysis, which is annually for most cases, but semiannual for natural gas.

}","Pursuant to a May 2013 final rule, Subpart W BAMM requests are due by June 30 of the year prior to the year in which reports are due (the “reporting year”) and for which BAMM is sought.  As June 30, 2013 falls on a weekend, BAMM requests for the 2014 reporting year are due by July 1, 2013.  The totality of the circumstances related to conducting isolation valve measurement on compressors in shutdown depressurized mode if fully explained in a proper Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) request may be considered by EPA to constitute unique or unusual circumstances justifying the use of BAMM.",1,"The answer does not address the main aspect of the question, which is whether EPA will approve the use of BAMM for measuring isolation valves at compressors in the shut down depressurized mode. Instead, the answer provides general information about the minimum frequency of measurement and analysis for various environmental regulations, the requirement for a triennial technology assessment report for semiconductor manufacturing facilities, the timing of extension requests for the use of best available monitoring methods, and the requirements for sampling and analysis for different types of compressors and fuels. While this information may be relevant to the topic of environmental regulations, it does not directly answer the question asked.",1,"The answer does not provide any information related to the use of BAMM for the measurement of isolation valves at compressors in the shut down depressurized mode.

126,Will EPA approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of individual compressor vents routed a common manifold?,"The document provides detailed requirements and methods for conducting volumetric emission measurements on individual and manifolded compressor sources. It specifies measurement methods for both centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources, including continuous monitoring, as well as methods for as found measurements. It also outlines calculation methodologies for annual volumetric GHG emissions associated with each manifolded group of compressor sources. The document allows for the use of best available monitoring methods for certain situations. It addresses the measurement and monitoring of emissions from compressor vents routed to a common manifold, providing the necessary methods and calculations for compliance. The document also includes various equations and conversion factors for calculating emissions, such as molecular weights, flow rates, emission factors, and conversion factors for different gases. Additionally, it provides default average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and crude oil production equipment, which can be used in emission calculations. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is likely that EPA will approve the use of Subpart W Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) relating to the measurement of individual compressor vents routed to a common manifold, as the document covers the necessary methods and calculations for compliance with environmental regulations.","The text provides detailed requirements and methods for conducting volumetric emission measurements on individual and manifolded compressor sources.

}","Facilities approved to use BAMM are still required to use the calculation methodologies and equations in § 98.233, and must comply with the reporting requirements in § 98.236.  The totality of the circumstances related to conducting measurement on compressors vents routed to a common manifold, if fully explained in a proper Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) request, may be considered by EPA to constitute unique or unusual circumstances justifying the use of BAMM. Pursuant to a May 2013 final rule, Subpart W BAMM requests are due by June 30 of the year prior to the year in which reports are due (the “reporting year”) and for which BAMM is sought. As June 30, 2013 falls on a weekend, BAMM requests for the 2014 reporting year are due by July 1, 2013.",5,"The answer provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the document's coverage of the measurement and monitoring of emissions from compressor vents routed to a common manifold, including the use of best available monitoring methods for compliance with environmental regulations. It also mentions the inclusion of various equations and default average component counts for emission calculations. The answer addresses all important aspects of the question and is highly relevant to the context.",5,"The document provides detailed requirements and methods for conducting volumetric emission measurements on individual and manifolded compressor sources. It specifies measurement methods for both centrifugal and reciprocating compressor sources, including continuous monitoring, as well as methods for as found measurements.

134,Are flare emissions included in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a)?,"The document provides detailed information about flare stack emissions, including the calculation of GHG emissions from flares and the inclusion of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from flaring gas. It also specifies the methods for calculating emissions for each flare, including the use of specific equations and considerations for gas composition and measurement frequency. Additionally, it outlines the correction of flare emissions to avoid double counting and the reporting requirements for excess emissions resulting from destruction device malfunctions. However, it does not explicitly mention whether flare emissions are included in the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources when determining applicability for Subpart W per §98.231(a). The document does not provide specific information or equations related to the 98.2(a)(3)(iii) combined emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources.

135,Emissions from flares are specifically excluded under 98.232(e) but methods for these emissions are provided in 98.233. Can you clarify which section of the rule is the correct guiding action?,"The document provides detailed information on the calculation and reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from flare stack emissions, atmospheric tanks, and well completions. It specifies the methodology for calculating emissions from flares according to § 98.233, including the exclusion of emissions from flares under 98.232(e). Additionally, it outlines the specific calculation methods for different scenarios such as well testing, associated gas emissions, and heat value or carbon content measurements. Overall, the document offers comprehensive guidance on the calculation and reporting of emissions related to flare stack operations. The exclusion of emissions from flares under 98.232(e) indicates that emissions from flares are specifically excluded from certain regulations, while the methodology for calculating emissions from flares is provided in § 98.233. Therefore, the correct guiding action for emissions from flares is to follow the methodology outlined in § 98.233.","The document provides detailed information on the calculation and reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from flare stack emissions, atmospheric tanks, and well completions.

136,Does a simple open pipe with no flare tip count as a flare under 98.233 (n ) in Subpart W?,"The document provides detailed information on various aspects of venting, flaring, and emissions calculations related to environmental regulations. However, it does not explicitly address whether a simple open pipe with no flare tip counts as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W. The provided equations and explanations mainly focus on emission factors, molar volume conversion factors, mass emissions, and other technical parameters related to emissions calculations. The tables include default whole gas emission factors, average component counts for major equipment, and designation of Eastern and Western U.S., among others. While the information is comprehensive, it does not directly answer the specific question about the classification of a simple open pipe without a flare tip as a flare under the mentioned regulation.","The document does not explicitly mention whether a simple open pipe with no flare tip counts as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W. However, it provides definitions and regulations related to various aspects of venting, flaring, tubing systems, natural gas pneumatic device venting, and common pipe configurations. It also includes information on the types of facilities and equipment required to report under Subpart W, as well as the methods and factors to be used for calculating emissions. The definition of 'flare' is provided as a combustion device that uses an open or closed flame to combust waste gases without energy recovery. The document also mentions the requirements for reporting CO2 emissions and provides information on equipment leaks, methane population emission factors, and engineering estimation methods. The specific details about whether a simple open pipe without a flare tip falls under the definition of a flare as per 98.233 (n) in Subpart W are not explicitly addressed in the provided text.{
