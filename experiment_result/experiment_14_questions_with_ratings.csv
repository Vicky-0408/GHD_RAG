23,How do I define a facility under subpart W? Are all industry segments included in one annual GHG report?,"Under subpart W, a facility is defined as any onshore petroleum and natural gas production facility, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering facility, onshore natural gas processing facility, onshore natural gas transmission compressor station, underground natural gas storage facility, LNG storage facility, LNG import and export equipment, and natural gas distribution facility. The emissions from all these industry segments are included in one annual GHG report. The subpart W requires reporting of emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, including the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from each stationary combustion unit, except for Waelz kilns, in both Eastern and Western U.S. as per the mapping in Table W–1D of this subpart. Additionally, the emissions from coal mine gas CH4 destruction occurring at the facility, where the gas is not a fuel input for energy generation or use, must also be reported under this subpart. Therefore, not all industry segments are included in one annual GHG report, and the definition of a facility under subpart W is specific to onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities.","by following the requirements of subpart C. unit by following the requirements of subpart C. under subpart RR of this part for a well or group of wells, you are not required to report under this subpart for that well or group of wells., (c) A facility that is subject to this part only ing the requirements of subpart C. applicable subpart shall take precedence., (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and  in subpart C of this part. subpart C. f subpart C. under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by following the requirements of subpart C. of subpart C of this part. of this subpart). w grade metering-regulating stations., (5) Distribution main equipment leaks., (6) Distribution services equipment leaks., (7) Report under subpart W of this part the emissions ustion Sources) by following the requirements of subpart C., (d) For CO<E T=""52"">2 collected and transferred off site, you must follow the requirements of subpart PP of this part. and report these emissions under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by following the requirements of subpart C of this part. naces according to the applicable requirements in subpart C. under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by following the requirements of subpart C., (d) CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emission eport emissions under subpart AA of this part (Pulp and Paper Manufacturing). ubpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by following the requirements of subpart C. ty that were not previously subject to this subpart W may use best engineering estimates for any data related to those newly acquired sources that cannot reasonably be measured or obtained according t because it is subject to subpart UU of this part is not required to report emissions under subpart C of this part or any other subpart listed in § 98.2(a)(1) or (a)(2). uirements of subpart C., (c) CO<E T=""52"">2, CH<E T=""52"">4, and N<E T=""52"">2O emissions from each stationary combustion unit other than Waelz kilns.

31,How did the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) affect emissions?,"The use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) had a significant impact on emissions in various industries. In 2011, BAMM allowed for the estimation of emissions for specific processes by monitoring changes in container weights and inventories using Equation T-1 of the subpart. Owners or operators were permitted to use best available monitoring methods to estimate emissions that occurred from January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011. The use of best available monitoring methods required the submission of revised 2011 emission estimates by March 31, 2013, if specific engineering models and apportioning factors developed through direct measurement were used and documented in the site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 40 CFR 98.3(g)(5). Additionally, facilities were allowed to request an extension of the use of best available monitoring methods to estimate 2011 emissions by providing scoping speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations. The methodology end date and total annual CO2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS, expressed in metric tons, were also required for each specific source type for which the use of best available monitoring methods was requested. If the proposed best available monitoring method was the use of current monitoring data in the mass-balance approach, facilities were required to include the estimated relative and absolute errors. Furthermore, if a CEMS was used to measure GHG emissions, the facility had to comply with the monitoring and QA/QC procedures specified in 40 CFR 98.34(c). In addition, BAMM affects emissions by providing emission factors for various components and equipment used in onshore petroleum and natural gas production, gathering, boosting, and other related activities. These emission factors help in estimating the emissions of methane and other hydrocarbons from different components such as valves, connectors, open-ended lines, pressure relief valves, pumps, and other equipment. The emission factors vary based on the type of service (gas, light crude, heavy crude, etc.) and the survey methods used. Furthermore, population emission factors are provided for distribution mains and services in the natural gas distribution sector. These default emission factors are crucial for estimating and managing emissions in the oil and gas industry. Finally, the use of BAMM affected emissions by providing a means to calculate and monitor various GHG emissions from different sources such as natural gas pneumatic device vents, nitric acid production, and fuel consumption. The calculations involve factors such as annual total volumetric GHG emissions, population emission factors, concentration of GHGs, and average estimated number of hours in the operating year. These methods enable the determination of emissions from specific processes and aid in identifying opportunities for emission reduction and control.","mber 31, 2011., (b) Emissions (consumption) of cover gases and carrier gases may be estimated by monitoring the changes in container weights and inventories using Equation T–1 of this subpart, best available monitoring methods in 2011 for scoping speciations, emission factors, or emission characterizations for certain processes must submit, by March 31, 2013, revised 2011 emission estimate ific engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement, provided this is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 98.3(g)(5)., (d) ent year emissions., (1) Best available monitoring methods.

34,"How do I determine ""actual"" temperature and pressure in emission calculations?","To determine the 'actual' temperature and pressure in emission calculations, one can use the default whole gas emission factors provided in the tables. These factors are specified for different components and services, such as gas service, light crude service, heavy crude service, gathering pipelines, etc. By using these emission factors along with the component counts for major equipment in the respective regions (Eastern U.S. or Western U.S.), one can estimate the actual emissions of methane or total hydrocarbons. It's important to note that the emission factors vary based on the survey methods used. Additionally, various factors need to be considered, such as the annual total volumetric GHG emissions at standard conditions, the population emission factors for natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, the concentration of GHG in produced natural gas, and the average estimated number of hours the devices were operational. Furthermore, accounting for the inventory of each cover gas or carrier gas stored in cylinders, the usage rate for a particular cover or carrier gas, and the abatement utilization factor of N2O abatement technology is crucial.

35,What are the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available?,"When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available, the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations can be determined in several ways. One approach is to use the default 95 percent methane and 1 percent carbon dioxide fraction for natural gas, or to utilize site-specific engineering estimates based on the best available data. Additionally, annual samples can be taken according to applicable methods, or hourly process activity rates can be used to estimate the GHG mole fraction. Another option is to use the default whole gas emission factors provided in tables W-1E, W-2, W-3A, W-4A, W-5A, W-6A, and W-7 to Subpart W of Part 98. These tables contain emission factors for various equipment components and services, which can be used in the absence of continuous gas composition analyzers. Furthermore, the calculation of the GHG mole fraction for emission estimates requires consideration of factors such as annual total volumetric GHG emissions at standard conditions, total number of natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, population emissions factors for these pumps, concentration of GHG in produced natural gas, and the average estimated number of operational hours for the pumps in the operating year.","termining the mole fraction.

36,What are the requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare?,"The requirements for determining the volume of gas sent to a flare involve several factors. Firstly, the molar volume conversion factor (scf per kg-mole) can be used as per Equation Y–3. Additionally, the volume of flare gas combusted can be calculated from the analysis results or engineering calculations for the event, considering the standard cubic feet of the flare gas and the annual average molecular weight (in kg/kg-mole) or the annual mass of flare gas combusted (in kg/yr). The flare stack may also have a continuous gas composition analyzer on the feed gas to the flare, which can provide valuable data for the calculation. In addition, the default whole gas emission factors provided in Table W-1A for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, gathering and boosting facilities can be used to estimate the emissions from various equipment components. Furthermore, the average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment and gathering and boosting equipment as listed in Table W-1B can be considered to calculate the total emissions. If emissions from leaking components need to be calculated, the default whole gas leaker emission factors provided in Table W-1E can be referred to. Finally, to calculate the volume of gas sent to a flare, the flow rate of the gas and the duration of time for which the gas is being sent need to be considered. The formula for calculating the volume of gas sent to a flare is Volume = Flow Rate * Time, where the flow rate is in a suitable unit such as standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) or standard cubic meters per hour (scmh), and the time is in hours. By multiplying the flow rate by the time, the volume of gas sent to the flare can be obtained in the appropriate unit.","device., (3) Indicate whether the flare stack has a continuous gas composition analyzer on feed gas to the flare., (4) Volume of gas sent to the flare, in standard cubic feet (“V<E T="" the flare gas, from the analysis results or engineering calculations for the event (kg/kg-mole) (Equation Y–3)., (10) Molar volume conversion factor (scf per kg-mole) (Equation Y–3).,  l volume of flare gas combusted (in scf/year) and the annual average molecular weight (in kg/kg-mole), or the annual mass of flare gas combusted (in kg/yr)., (7) If you use Equation Y–1b of § re gas prior to combustion in each flare that is contributed by methane from measurement values or engineering calculations (kg C in methane in flare gas/kg C in flare gas) (Equation Y–4 of § 98.253). ndication of whether the annual volume of flare gas combusted and the annual average higher heating value of the flare gas were determined using standard conditions of 68 °F and 14.7 psia or 60 °F and d of flare stacks in paragraph (n) of this section to determine emissions from the flare for gas well venting to a flare during completions and workovers without hydraulic fracturing., (i)  3) of this section., (1) Volume of flare gas combusted during measurement period (scf) (Equation Y–1b of § 98.253)., (2) Mole percent CO<E T=""52"">2 concentration in the flare gas s metric tons CH<E T=""52"">4, that resulted from venting gas directly to the atmosphere., (xiv) If you controlled emissions from any atmospheric tanks at your facility with one or more flares ion factor (scf per kg-mole) (Equation Y–1b)., (6) Annual volume of flare gas combusted for each flare during normal operations from company records (million (MM) standard cubic feet per year, for well(s) with associated gas venting and flaring and the well ID number(s) for the well(s) included in the measurement., (6) Total volume of associated gas sent to sales, in standard cubic ead of a flare or vent, to measure the gas flowback.

39,How does this final rule relate to EPA's Natural Gas STAR program?,"The final rule primarily focuses on reporting requirements, emission standards, and calculation methods for greenhouse gas emissions associated with various industrial activities, such as natural gas processing, distribution, and other anthropogenic sources. It provides default whole gas emission factors for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, specifically for leaking and non-leaking components. These factors are essential for estimating methane emissions from different equipment components. While the final rule addresses greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas-related activities, it does not explicitly align with the voluntary principles and practices promoted by the EPA's Natural Gas STAR program. The Natural Gas STAR program is a voluntary program that provides resources and recognition for reducing methane emissions in the oil and natural gas sectors, encouraging the use of cost-effective technologies and practices to complement the regulatory requirements by providing additional guidance and support for emission reduction efforts.

62,Why did EPA require that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin?,"The EPA required that facilities conducting onshore petroleum and natural gas production report by basin for several reasons. Firstly, the geologic provinces or basins provide a standardized and organized way to categorize and analyze the data, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact in specific geological regions. This enables targeted regulatory and mitigation efforts. Secondly, reporting by basin facilitates the comparison of emissions and operational data across different regions, aiding in the identification of trends, hotspots, and best practices for environmental management and compliance. Additionally, this approach captures regional variations in emissions and allows for the differentiation of emission factors based on geographical location, which can be influenced by factors such as geology, climate, and production practices. Finally, the reporting structure also enables better tracking and monitoring of annual CO2 mass emissions for specific fuel types in metric tons, leading to a more accurate assessment and management of the environmental impact of onshore petroleum and natural gas production.","ore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting.

63,"If a facility does not have a GOR value for a well, what options are available to facilities in order to determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring?","Facilities without a Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) value for a well may determine GOR for associated gas venting and flaring by utilizing reservoir engineering techniques to estimate the GOR based on the well's production history, fluid analysis, and reservoir characteristics. They can also calculate the GOR by dividing the volume of gas produced by the volume of oil produced over a specific period of time. Additionally, they can consider using proxy GOR values from nearby wells with similar geological and operational parameters, subject to appropriate validation and justification. It's essential to ensure that the selected method aligns with regulatory requirements and industry best practices to accurately estimate GOR for reporting purposes. Furthermore, they can use historical GOR data from similar wells in the same field or region, estimate GOR based on reservoir characteristics and production history, utilize empirical correlations or models, or conduct a well test to measure GOR directly.

67,How do I determine the gas to oil ratio (GOR) for my gathering pipelines?,"The gas to oil ratio (GOR) for gathering pipelines is determined based on the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure produced from a volume of oil. The GOR is calculated for each well, and if individual well GOR is not available, the GOR from a cluster of wells is used. Gathering pipelines with a GOR less than 300 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel (scf/STB) are not included in the industry segment. Therefore, the GOR for gathering pipelines is determined based on the specific characteristics of the wells and the cluster of wells in the area. To calculate the GOR, you would need to measure the volume of gas and oil being produced and then divide the volume of gas by the volume of oil. Additionally, you can use the default whole gas emission factors provided in Table W-1A to Subpart W of Part 98 to calculate the total gas emissions based on the appropriate emission factors for the components in your gathering pipelines and the average component counts for major onshore natural gas production equipment.

78,How should I calculate the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids?,"Based on the provided information, for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater, they should be considered under the onshore natural gas processing segment. These plants do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere and should report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. Specifically, they need to report the GHG mole fraction in facility-specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing structure, and pipelines delivering natural gas directly to major industrial users and farm taps upstream of the local distribution company inlet. To calculate the reporting threshold, you can use the default emission factors provided in Table W-2 to Subpart W of Part 98, which specifies emission factors for different equipment components. By multiplying the appropriate emission factor with the average component counts for the major onshore natural gas production equipment and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting equipment, you can estimate the total emissions from these facilities. Additionally, the reporting threshold for onshore natural gas processing plants that do not fractionate gas liquids is 25,000 metric tons of CO2e per year, as specified in 40 CFR 98.230.","plants that do not fractionate gas liquids but have an annual average throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater., (4) Onshore natural gas transmission compression.

Onshore petroleum and nat ","What constitutes a facility, how to determine the reporting threshold, and reporting of emissions from collocated and dual purpose equipment is as follows: 1) As a first step the reporter must determine the emissions from all equipment listed in 98.232(c) for onshore petroleum and production.  Per section 98.231(a) only sources listed in 98.232(c) need to be considered for threshold determination for onshore petroleum and natural gas production. 98.238 defines “facility” for the purposes of onshore petroleum and natural gas systems.  Per the requirements of 98.3 each “facility” must submit a GHG report for all source categories at that “facility”.  2) Note that while identifying onshore production emissions sources reporters have to determine whether the source is “on the well pad or associated with a well pad”.  The location of production wells within other facilities is inconsequential to this determination.  Sources on a well pad or associated with a well pad across the entire reporting basin have to be taken into consideration.  If your emissions from onshore petroleum and natural gas production are equal to or greater than 25,000mtCO2e, then onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities report as a separate facility and include all emissions sources listed in 98.232(c).  3) Except for onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution, which have unique facility definitions, all other segments subject to subpart W are considered in the threshold determination for a single facility.  You would also include emissions from other source categories at your facility (e.g., stationary combustion).  If there are emissions sources that are dual purpose then the rule requires this piece of equipment to be reported under the majority use industry segment based on guidance provided in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14 (pp. 1606-1608).  4) For collocated industry segments, which cannot occur in the case of onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas distribution due to the requirements in 98.231(a), EPA has provided guidance on emissions reporting in EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0923-1024-14.  Based on the information provided, the facility cannot be reported as onshore production and natural gas processing combined (see point 1 above).  For all the other segments, the report should use guidance in points 2-3 above to determine the segment under which the facility should be categorized.",5,The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how to report a facility that combines onshore petroleum and natural gas production and natural gas storage by injecting natural gas for the purposes of both enhanced oil recovery and storage.

100,Are dehydration units that are used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility?,"Dehydration units used to dehydrate natural gas extracted from underground storage are not included within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility. This conclusion is supported by the text analysis, table analysis, and formula analysis. The text analysis explicitly states that these units are not included within the definition. The table analysis indicates that specific inclusion of dehydration units within the definition of underground natural gas storage facility is not explicitly mentioned in the provided tables. The formula analysis reinforces this by explaining that dehydration units are separate facilities designed to remove water vapor from the natural gas, rather than being a part of the storage facility itself. Therefore, based on the integrated analysis, it can be concluded that dehydration units used for this purpose are not considered part of the underground natural gas storage facility.","atural gas underground storage processes and operations (including compression, dehydration and flow measurement, and excluding transmission pipelines); and all the wellheads connected to the compress natural gas dehydrator system absorbent (typically glycol) reboiler or regenerator to the atmosphere or a flare, including stripping natural gas and motive natural gas used in absorbent circulation p l gas from onshore production gas or oil wells and used to compress, dehydrate, sweeten, or transport the petroleum and/or natural gas to a natural gas processing facility, a natural gas transmission P>, (iii) Dehydrator feed natural gas water content, in pounds per million standard cubic feet., (iv) Dehydrator outlet natural gas water content, in pounds per million standard cubic feet. h water vapor exceeds the concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered from transmission and distribution pipelines.

We also recognize that there is a related comment and response in, “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments: “2011 Technical Revisions to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Category of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule” (see DCN: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0512-0030) where EPA may also appear to reject the 10%-10%-40%-20%-20% approach outlined above.  However, EPA understood the commenter’s recommendation as to be suggesting measurement of 10% of stations per year, over a ten year period. EPA’s objection to the comment to monitor 10% of stations per year would have been inconsistent with a five-year cycle.  Yes.   According to 98.233(q)(8)(i), “Natural gas distribution facilities may choose to conduct leak detection at T-D transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all T-D transfer stations.  If the facility chooses to use the multiple year option, then the number of T-D transfer stations monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle without monitoring the same station twice during the multiple year survey.”  EPA confirms that an approach of conducting monitoring at 10% of the facilities in each of the first two years, followed by 40%, 20% and 20% in years three, four and five would be consistent with the rule language that the number of stations monitored be “approximately equal” over the number of years surveyed.",1,The answer completely lacks relevance to the question about monitoring plans and station percentages.,1,"The answer states that the monitoring plan described is not consistent with the rule language of 'approximately equal across all years in the cycle.'

129,Do dehydrators which are used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator?,"Yes, dehydrators used to dry a liquid stream meet the definition of dehydrator as they are designed to remove water vapor from the input stream, typically using a liquid absorbent such as desiccant or glycol to absorb the water vapor from the wet gas.

130,The emission methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd in the preamble (use flow rate of wet NG and EF) contradict the requirements in the rule (use dehydrator count and EF).,"The emission methods for dehydrator vents with daily throughputs less than 0.4 MMscfd in the preamble contradict the requirements in the rule.

137,"Under Subpart W, under both the onshore production and gas processing source categories, are we required to report emissions from all flares at the gas processing facility or on or associated with a well pad, including emergency flares?","Based on the text analysis, the specific requirement for reporting emissions from all flares at the gas processing facility or associated with a well pad, including emergency flares, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content. However, the reporting requirements for emissions from gas processing facilities and well pads are detailed in subpart W of the regulations. Therefore, the reporting of emissions from all flares, including emergency flares, should be determined based on the specific guidelines and definitions provided in subpart W of the regulations. Additionally, the table analysis indicates that under Subpart W, for both the onshore production and gas processing source categories, emissions from all flares at the gas processing facility or on or associated with a well pad, including emergency flares, are required to be reported. This information is based on the default emission factors and population emission factors provided in the tables for different equipment components and services. It is important to note that these default emission factors are to be used if the facility does not have direct measurements and follows the specified survey methods for estimation. However, the formula analysis does not directly relate to the question about reporting emissions from flares at gas processing facilities. Therefore, it is recommended to review the specific regulations and guidelines under Subpart W to determine the exact requirements for reporting emissions from flares at gas processing facilities.","applicable subpart shall take precedence., (c) For facilities required to report under onshore petroleum and natural gas production under subpart W of this part, the terms Owner and  r onshore natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting; and Table W–1C of this subpart for onshore oil production.
