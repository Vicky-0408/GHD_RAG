35,What are the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations when a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available?,"When a continuous gas composition analyzer is not available, the requirements for determining the GHG mole fraction for emission calculations include taking annual samples according to specified methods to determine the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for upstream emissions sources and in facility specific residue gas for downstream emissions sources in onshore natural gas processing facilities. Additionally, the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas liquid must be determined for all streams in onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream. For local distribution pipeline natural gas and natural gas stored in the LNG import and export industry segment, default methane and carbon dioxide fractions or site-specific engineering estimates may be used. In cases where specific methods cannot be used, a representative analysis may be selected. It is also essential to develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and N2O consumption for each input gas, process sub-type, process type, stack system, and fab as appropriate. Furthermore, to accurately determine the GHG mole fraction, information such as fuel mass or volume combusted per year, annual natural gas usage, annual CO2 mass emissions, high heat value of the fuel, fuel-specific default CO2 emission factor, and the conversion factor from therms to mmBtu is required. Additionally, the volumetric flow rate of effluent gas per test run, production rate per test run, and the number of test runs are essential parameters for accurate GHG mole fraction determination and subsequent emission calculations.","If you do not have a continuous gas composition analyzer, then annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b) to determine the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for all emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, as well as the GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities. Additionally, you must use the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas liquid for all streams in onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream. For local distribution pipeline natural gas that passes through the facility, you may use either a default 95 percent methane and 1 percent carbon dioxide fraction or site-specific engineering estimates based on best available data. Similarly, for natural gas stored in the LNG import and export industry segment, you may use either a default 95 percent methane and 1 percent carbon dioxide fraction or site-specific engineering estimates based on best available data.

Facilities must re-evaluate whether they fall below this threshold if there is a significant change in their throughput that may affect their classification.,"However, please note that if, in year 2, your throughput capacity is less than 25 MMscf per day, you are not required to calculate and report GHG emissions from gas processing in year 2.  You would still be required to report other covered emissions at your facility.  This is because gas processing would not be an applicable segment for year 2.  Nevertheless, your facility would still be required to report in year 2, even if facility-wide emissions are less than 25,000mt CO2e, and would continue to report until you meet the criteria in 98.2(i) for ceasing to report.  The gas processing plant throughput threshold in 98.230(a)(3) is based on annual average throughput.  This throughput is re-evaluated annually.  Once you are subject to the rule (e.g., your facility contains a source category listed in Table A-4), your facility must continue complying with all the requirements of this part, even if the facility does not meet the applicability requirements in a future year (i.e., 25,000 mtCO2e for petroleum and natural gas systems). The definition of the source category for petroleum and natural gas systems, under onshore natural gas processing, refers to a processing facility that does not fractionate and has a throughput of 25MMscf per day or greater.  Because a gas processing facility that is over 25 MMscf per day meets the definition of the source category for subpart W, any facility that becomes subject to the rule in whole or in part because of a natural gas processing facility, would have to continue reporting until it meets the conditions for cessation of reporting in 98.2(i).",5,"The answer provides a complete and accurate response to the question, addressing both the basis for the 25 MMscfd threshold and the frequency of re-evaluation required for facilities.

85,What is the difference between the methods in 98.233(k) and 98.234(a)(1) for monitoring tank emissions?  How do we treat intermittent emission from the storage tank? Can we use an alternative method to quantify the emissions?,"The method for monitoring tank emissions involves the annual monitoring of the tank vapor vent stack for emissions using specified methods. For CH4 liberated at degasification systems, operators have flexibility in monitoring from each well and gob gas vent hole, from a centralized monitoring point, or from a combination of the two options. The monitoring of both gas volume and methane concentration can be done through continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) using the Tier 4 Calculation Method, following associated calculation, quality assurance, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. The calculation and reporting of CH4 and N2O emissions are not required as part of the Tier 4 requirements for AGR units. The monitoring and reporting of emissions from ventilation systems and storage tanks involve specific monitoring methods and documentation requirements. Therefore, the intermittent emissions from the storage tank can be quantified using the specified monitoring methods, and alternative methods can be used as long as they comply with the regulatory requirements.","The method for monitoring tank emissions involves the annual monitoring of the tank vapor vent stack for emissions using specified methods.

Therefore, the intermittent emissions from the storage tank can be quantified using the specified monitoring methods, and alternative methods can be used as long as they comply with the regulatory requirements.","The purpose of this detection and measurement is to determine and quantify any continuous gas emissions from condensate storage tanks.  The most common source of vapor emissions from a transmission compressor station condensate tank would be liquid transfer from compressor scrubber dump valves.  These sources operating properly would be intermittent transfer of liquids from high pressure vessels to an atmospheric storage tank, with a short term flashing of dissolved gas, which is assumed to be less than 5 minutes in duration.  Malfunction of scrubber dump valves can result in high pressure vapor leaking through the valve, into the condensate tank, and out the tank roof vent, which would vent indefinitely.  This continuous release of vapor is detected as a continuous blow of gas from the condensate tank roof vent using a leak imaging camera or by using an acoustic through-valve leak detection instrument.  Based on the current rule, when using an optical gas imaging instrument, the tank needs to be monitored to determine whether the tank vapors are continuous for 5 minutes; see section 98.233(k)(2).  So if a leak is detected per requirements of 98.234(a)(1) and is continuous per the requirements of 98.233(k)(2) then the reporter has to measure the emissions per requirements in 98.233(k)(2)(i)-(iv).  The reporter has the choice of using an acoustic leak detection device to detect and measure leaks per requirements in 98.234(a)(5).  You cannot use alternative methods to those outlined in the rule.",5,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the methods for monitoring tank emissions, including the flexibility for CH4 monitoring, the use of CEMS, and the specific monitoring methods and documentation requirements for emissions from ventilation systems and storage tanks.

110,Please explain how many leak detection surveys must be conducted a calendar year?  Must a facility indicate in advance how many surveys will be conducted in the year?,"At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year, and it must be conducted during that year. If multiple complete leak detection surveys are conducted in a calendar year, the results from each survey must be used when calculating emissions using Equation W–30. Components subject to the well site and compressor station fugitive emissions standards in § 60.5397a of this chapter require each survey conducted in accordance with § 60.5397a to be considered a complete leak detection survey. Natural gas distribution facilities performing equipment leak surveys across a multiple year leak survey cycle must report the number of years in the leak survey cycle. Additionally, facilities may choose to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, not exceeding a five year period to cover all above grade stations. The number of transmission-distribution transfer stations that are monitored in each year should be approximately equal across all years in the cycle. Therefore, a facility must conduct at least one leak detection survey in a calendar year, and for facilities performing equipment leak surveys across a multiple year leak survey cycle, the number of surveys conducted will depend on the specific cycle chosen by the facility.","At least one leak detection survey must be conducted in a calendar year, and it must be conducted during that year.

135,Emissions from flares are specifically excluded under 98.232(e) but methods for these emissions are provided in 98.233. Can you clarify which section of the rule is the correct guiding action?,"The correct guiding action for the calculation of flare stack emissions is provided in § 98.233 of the rule. This section outlines the methodology for calculating CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from flares, including the adjustment of emissions for the portion of gas flared during well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing. It also specifies the requirements for calculating GHG emissions from flares, as well as the correction of flare emissions to avoid double counting. Therefore, the relevant guidance for the calculation of flare stack emissions is detailed in § 98.233 of the rule.","The correct guiding action for the calculation of flare stack emissions is provided in § 98.233 of the rule.

136,Does a simple open pipe with no flare tip count as a flare under 98.233 (n ) in Subpart W?,"No, a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not count as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W. This conclusion is supported by the text analysis. There are no conflicting results from table or formula analysis to suggest otherwise.","No, a simple open pipe with no flare tip does not count as a flare under 98.233 (n) in Subpart W.","40 CFR § 98.238 defines a flare as “…a combustion device, whether at ground level or elevated, that uses an open or closed flame to combust waste gases without energy recovery.”  An open pipe without combustion would not be considered a flare, but any hydrocarbon releases through it would be considered “vented emissions” under §98.238, which includes “process designed flow to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes.”",5,"The answer directly addresses the question and provides a clear and accurate response, supported by the context and relevant information.
